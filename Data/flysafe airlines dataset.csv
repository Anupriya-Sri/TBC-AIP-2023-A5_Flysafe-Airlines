32,"Matt was great, very responsive and hard working",Postive
33,Matt was friendly and clearly interested in exactly what our priorities were. He was very clear that it may take a week or two to find the fare we were looking for. To his word he came back with a great fare to Australia ($1500 less per traveler than the anything comparable we could find) and not on some obscure carrier but on the 5 star Cathay Pacific. He followed us completely through the booking process. I will be sharing this experience with all my friends as FlyworldClass.com has proven to me to be the real thing in a field of characters making huge claims they don't come through on.

37,"I have had nothing but trouble dealing with this company during the pandemic. We have gotten the total run around trying to get a refund for a flight that was changed, despite the fact that the Department of Transportation has instructed the airlines to do so amidst all the travel dilemmas. We have been trying to get this resolve since early June, and have been put off at least a dozen times with excuses.Now we cannot even get on the scheduled flight because our destination won’t allow Americans in. Our agent, Steve, does not answer our voicemails, nor does he answer his phone. We will never use a consolidator again for Business travel—or certainly not this one. If there is any customer service agent with this company who might be interested in helping us, Please respond to this review. I have been told that I must pay a fee of $500/ ticket for my husband and me to get any money back.  As a senior citizen who has compromising health conditions, I should not take this flight, even if I were allowed into the EU. No one seems to care...",Negative

At first I thought that it may be scam as I got scammed prior; but taking a risk and buying from yesfares assured me that this will be the only site I’ll be only buying from. Travis found me a such a perfect connection, for requested price with no hassle! I was probably pain in the a** still rejecting his offers (even when they were good); but as I was picky person inward looking for best connections possible - and he found it!

169,NOT your usual private charter customers. However since we were relocating to Ecuador in the midst of a pandemic with two huge dogs we had few options.

Frankly I'd give them a six if I could,Postive

The pilot was nice and very informative, so we felt super comfortable boarding the plane.  He immediately put all my worries and anixiety at ease with his step by step tutorial.   He wore a mask while piloting us back to the states.  He pointed out islands below and gave us a play by play. The plane was comfortable and clean.  It was one of the smoothest flights I’ve been on.

Then I ran across the ASAP ticket website while searching Google. Was call only which I thought right away would be just another elaborate scheme for a salesman to operate on me. Lol Luckily I talked to an agent named Russell who immediately understood my dilemma and began helping just like he said he would. After spending most of a morning online shopping and comparing prices it was such a relief to let someone else handle it. Russell was very professional and well spoken and seemed to know exactly what I needed. And although he did present to me various deals on lodging and other things, he was not pushy and overbearing as most of my encounters with salesmen have demonstrated. He walked me through the process quickly and efficiently and got me the absolute cheapest price of any of the dozen other agencies I had searched. Would I recommend this to a friend. Yes, most certainly. I have also added Russell's contact info and email and plan to make no other calls or searches for any future ticket purchases.

Until now i still don't know how will i get the refund! I you don’t want problems do not use this agent! Never in your life... stay away from them!

I received little help from SkyLux to get my refund so I went straight to United.  I got them to issue a FULL refund for my entire charge back to SkyLux credit card which I have proof from the airline and the last 4 of their cc it was refunded to on 7/21/2020.  They continue to give me a run around about where my refund is and that they are waiting on ""their bank"".  When I ask for proof that the refund was submitted and when I will get my $4400 they do not respond.  According to the US Dept of Transportation How quickly is an airline, travel agent, or online travel agency required to process a refund? If a passenger is owed a refund, an airline, travel agent, or online travel agency must process it within seven business days if the passenger paid by credit card It has been 16 business days since SkyLux has received my FULL refund from UNITED yet they will not issue my FULL refund to my cc.  I am filing with the Atty General right now.  The Consumer Protection Agency is there for this very reason.

259,"So... here's an update. Since my flight was cancelled by the Airline in April, I have been waiting to get my refund from Business-Class.com. That was 4 months ago. After my last review, on July 28, 2020 a woman named Ms. Sage Collins - The Customer Service Manager from Business-Class.com sent an email wanting to discuss my concerns with me. See below - First she stated - ""Business Class as a wholesaler who sold you a business class ticket on Lufthansa Airlines - does not refuse/deny the refund you're entitled to"". ""Back in March, we were still operating under the assumption that refunds will be approved and we can receive the funds in a timely manner, while closer to the end of April, we realized that airlines started to passively ignore normal standardized procedures, as their primary objective abruptly changed into ""survival mode"". Lufthansa Group did start recently to grant refunds, nonetheless, the process is more complex and it takes a lot of time to receive an answer on the status of the transaction. Therefore I want to clarify that we are not denying you any refunds, that for the time being, we can issue a voucher and continue working on this, simply because we can not refund a financial amount that is not currently present in our accounts. We are estimating 6 to 8 months, but I hope to able to revert to this in 3 -4 months, this is when we expect the airlines to resume their normal schedule, which will give us a clearer picture and more latitude."" I informed Ms. Collins that I had verification from Lufthansa Airlines that a refund was issue to them on July 2, 2020. Ms. Collins also explained to me that the CARE Act policy from The U.S. Dept. of Transportation regarding ticket refunds within 7 days, does not apply to On-Line travel Agencies. According to Ms. Collins, "" Refund requirements do not apply to us as a travel agency."" She further explained that although the Airlines had refunded my ticket back to Business-Class.com on July 2, 2020, it was in fact stuck in some kind of purgatory merchants account? See below response - She states - "" We can process a refund in 6 -8 months - depending on when our merchant will post the funds in our account and the volume of incoming requests."" ""we are stuck in the middle of a large chain: merchants/consolidators/suppliers/airline company (as the final piece of puzzle who actually owns the inventory on their planes)."" So basically, Business-Class.com is now estimating another 6-8 months for a full refund. That will put me at approximately one year of waiting for a refund. The other option offered was  - that I except 50% of my money as a settlement, with the remaining 50% in a voucher. Then I am to wait another 12 months to possible ""cash out"" the voucher if not use. See below email responses. 1st response - ""In consideration of the foregoing, we are ready to issue a refund from our savings fund through a settlement, as per the time being, in the amount of the 50% and issue a voucher for the rest of 50 % with the possibility to cash out in 12 Months."" 2nd response - ""With all these mentioned above, we as a company are doing more than just going by the book. Refund requirements do not apply to us as a travel agency. There is no definition of a prompt refund. Regardless of that, we choose to provide a similar service. We are still giving you several options, one being a 50 % refund from our saving funds and a 50 % in 12 months, or more prompt option being a refund in 6 -8 months - depending on when our merchant will post the funds in our account and the volume of incoming requests."" In addition, as a reminder - Sage referred to the Terms and Conditions. It states ""You will not receive a monetary refund when cancelling. Instead, you will receive a credit (less any airline /hotel fees) towards a future ticket purchase on long haul international flights equal or greater value, which will be valid for up to twelve (12) months from your original purchase date."" I'm not sure how this still applies to me, since I DID NOT cancel my flight! Why did she present this to me, if I'm being granted a refund/settlement? Why are they using the term ""settlement"" for a refund? If they are willing to pay me 50% of my refund now through their savings as a ""settlement"", knowing that they have my refund coming through their merchant creditor. Why wouldn't they just pay me the full amount now? Ms. Collins also made reference to the struggle Business-Class.com has endured through the COVID 19 pandemic. How hard it's been for them as a company. What about the struggle of their customers? Are we not feeling the impact of this pandemic? People are lo This money could be used to pay bills. Feed my family. Why should anyone have to wait a year or longer for a refund? As of today August 14, 2020. I have NOT receive a refund. I guess we'll have to wait and see what happens.",Negative

I am hoping to get “ a compassionate leave to remain “ that is still uncertain and she has ensured that this new ticket, should I need to change this again will incur no other fee than an adjustment in price. She has gone above and beyond in her efforts to help me and I would recommend her and Business-class.com for travel arrangements that anybody may have. It is amazing that anyone should go to such lengths to help a traveler who merely  bought a ticket online. Having used many online ticket sites I can assure you that none could compare with the fantastic service given me through Business-class.com and in particular Emma Paterson.",Postive

268,"We purchased 4 business class tickets few weeks ago. Traveling under COVID-19 was a major concern. Flying in business class gave us a sense of safety. Avoiding a COVID-19 infection was obviously our priority. First of all our purchase experience has been outstanding. Luke was awesome, professional, courteous and very effective. We were able to book our flights with AF and Swiss Air at a very competitive cost to say the least. We were kept apprised at each step of the process and promises were kept. The level of service has been and remains exceptional, as we are still on the go. Luke has been following-up making sure our experience would remain outstanding even if changes due to COVID—19 occurred. Our first leg flight experience with AF has been very good as well even if the overall service was cut short for obvious sanitary reasons. Only 3 other passengers were flying in business class that day. This was awesome and kept us safe. The flight attendants were super friendly and courteous. Our seats were very comfortable. Our babies felt secure. They both enjoyed the entertainment offered. At one point we all fell a sleep in our respective and secluded pods. The food was unfortunately not as good as expected. I remember the days when AF had better meals especially in business class. This was maybe the only negative aspect of the overall flight. The Champagne was good though. To make a long story short our experience has been very positive from the purchase, follow-up and support point of view. The family flew in a very safe environment. We were all healthy and happy to land in Paris rested, fed, entertained especially under very challenging conditions. Mission accomplished! Everyone kept their respective promises. We finally went through custom safely and healthy w/o any issues. Our ride was ready on time and life remained beautiful since then. Thank you all for your great help and dedication!",Postive

He was diligent and relentless in finding the best flights that meet our needs and budget.  Though we eventually to cancel our flights, this didn't stop Mason from taking care of us.  He continues to serve our best interest by helping me navigate the complex and timely process of getting resolution on our refunds with the airline companies.  This is how great Mason is ... he called me 1st when he knew that our flights were canceled by the airlines.  He regularly calls me to give me an update on the status of my refunds and vouchers.

Hightlight 1- Airline confirms full refund eligible for my tickets. But this agent, say refund not allowed /huge penalty. Hightlight 2- Refund , Agency take my card details for commission amount 85$ and revert back saying - my card is invalid / discontinued. Asked for new card details. I have clearly said *NO* more card with me. Next day, they charged my previously given card. Would you say, this is a *FRAUD* or something else.

Flight Guru is not refunding our money and is offering ""credit"".  They would not guarantee that we would not pay more in the future to get to Italy with this ""credit"".  We are unable to rebook as everyone knows because of the uncertainty of traveling abroad with this virus.

I currently have NO reservations and no proof of ""credit"" and have paid $7335.46!!!!  We want to be refunded completely by this company.

403,Cancelled flight by Airline and was told that a refund was not possible. Flight cancelled because of Covid by airline. We were told that because it was a non refundable ticket no refund could be made. Be aware if you are traveling to make a connection to a cruise or some other event and the airline cancels your flight you may be out tow different expenses. Coming out of this environment we are now in it will be hard to have much faith in airline travel the way it is being handled now. What if a flight only has a few passengers and decides to cancel. Don't expect Alpha Flight Guru to help after you have paid sometimes months in advance.,Negative

They actually have another name here on TrustPilot: ""Alpha Media Group LLC"" (You may have noticed the charge on your credit card said ""AMG Travel"") Anyone reading these reviews, you have recourse. Dispute the charge with your bank or credit card company. File a consumer complaint with the BBB in California, file a complaint with the CA Attorney General, and most important, file your complaint with the US DOT! Google: ""USDOT Air Travel Service Complaint or Comment Form (Not Related to Airline Safety or Security Issues)"" My experience: Booked three RT tickets from EWR to AMS for 25 April to 13 May. Was super skeptical about the booking because COVID was on the horizon. ""Ken"" told me that if I cancel I would get a refund once the airline refunded them. I took it upon myself to contact United on April 8th and they confirmed that they would refund the full fare, but the refund would go to FlightGuru (aka ""AMG Travel""). After numerous emails to Ken, first he said he had to confirm with his ""supplier"" that a refund was given, and it may take several billing cycles to get it, then sent another email saying that it was not refundable, saying: ""It's because the money is already with our supplier and we were denied for refund. Trust me, I am with you on this, however, we can't refund something that we don't have."" I disputed the charge today with my credit card, and it was IMMEDIATELY reversed.",Negative

But it's TRUE what they say. You get what you pay for.  And I'm absolutely regretting having book with this extremely shady dishonest operation.

Within a day they had come back to me saying that the airline had refused to pay out, and therefore it would need to go to court. It would then of course mean fees going up, and my payout reducing considerably. There was no evidence provided of this response from the airline, which rang alarm bells. I therefore emailed the airline directly, and they agreed to pay out in full without any hassle. It was alarming to me about how little evidence was provided of the airline’s refusal. Given how easily they paid me out directly, it seems poor that either Inspecto do not have the expertise to get the immediate payout, or that they are underhand enough to lie to clients in order to increase their fees. Very poor service, and I terminated services as a result. Avoid.",Postive

536,"I booked an April 2020 PAL flight for my Dad in December 2019. At the end of March 2020, the flight was canceled and the booking was processed for a refund on April 3rd. It will be 19 weeks today and the flight is not refunded to my credit card yet. Every month, I email (csd@mangotours) for updates regarding the refund. Which, by the way, if they tell you to email them there for updates, you will most likely NOT get an update and instead just an email asking you for your patience. So far, I have been in communication with Trixia Mae Grey, Kristine Belga, and Baby Renwen Ramos. Everybody seems to tell me the same thing- that it was forwarded to the airline and they are awaiting their response. I asked to be CC’ed in the email to PAL or even get PAL’s email address so I can be in direct communication (since Mango Tours seems like they don’t know what is going on either), and they said they, unfortunately, cannot do that because “their Sales Manager” is the only one directly communicating with PAL. Why can’t their Sales Manager CC me then? Why can they not forward this issue with their Sales Manager? Are they not communicating within the company either? Instead, they forwarded me an outdated timeline on how long the process would take as of June 2020. I usually am a person that has a lot of patience and would very rarely write a bad review but this whole process is very frustrating I’m sure, not just for me, but to a lot of families who are still awaiting their refund. I am in the process of writing a complaint to BBB and also reporting PAL to DOT. It seems that most of the positive reviews here seem to NOT be an accurate representation of what has been going on between the company and its customers (something that also needs to be brought up to Trustpilot regarding accurate reviews). So to those who are still awaiting refunds, I encourage you all to write a review and report/speak up about these issues we are all having- write a review here, tag them on social media, post about it, etc. The more we bring it up to the public eye, the more likely that they will have to deal with it, because at this point, who knows if we’re even going to get our refunds at all?",Negative

552,"Hello my friends Long Thing Read complete Fraud Details, I booked my travel with Tripfur in December of 2019 for Jan 2020 travel. Initially Neeraj gave a good Service, asked Credit card details, then picture of my credit card front and back, then had to electronically sign the credit card authorization Form and then had to send a copy of my US Passport. Everything went well and then entered Shilpa who sent me the electronic ticket. My onwards journey went well. But during my return, I casually called the airlines the day before to reconfirm my return journey and came to know domestic connecting flight was cancelled. It would have been a big mess if I would not have called to reconfirm. I tried calling/ Emailed Neeraj from India to USA and he does not respond. Finally early morning at 2.00am I got a call from Saurabh on the day of travel giving me options. I told Saurabh I have already booked for another domestic flight to Bangalore, since I did not want to miss the International flight to USA and Saurabh said that is excellent and refunded the domestic flight ticket money back to me. But when I went to the airport, the domestic people say that I have to pay for the 2 big 23kgs check in Bags (Very Rarely you expect someone Travelling Internationally will come with a Handbag including Laptop with 8KGS). I called Tripfur people and they asked to proceed with the payment and they will reimburse me here in USA. So I did pay for my baggage. After lots of flight changes reached home. Totally Mad with 40hrs of journey instead of 24hrs. Had no other option since I had to get back to work. Since February till June 14th , 2020(Many people entered into the picture(Saurabh, Mandeep, Mohnish, Ashish Etc, Etc) they said they will refund me back my Baggage paid amount(I have all proofs of the email sent by Tripfur people promising me the refund) and it is just a delay due to COVID-19. I believed in them. I started asking them strongly about my refund and received an email on June 14th, 2020 that my refund has been rejected by the management. I sent an email on July 15, 2020 saying that I am going to take a legal action and report to BBB. They did not even care or respond back. Now I am frustrated with this guys and have decided to proceed legally. Here my problem is not about money, about the pain I have taken in the airports and about the way I was cheated by this TRIPFUR.COM and TRIPFUR.NET Company. One more company by name KONASTH SOLUTION P came up in one email. I don’t know what that company is! FRIENDS PLEASE DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY/ TIME AND CURSE ON YOUR TRIP BY BOOKING WITH TRIPFUR.COM AND TRIPFUR.NET COMPANY.

DISGUSTING COMPANY. THANK YOU.",Negative
553,"Really, they have a 4+ rating? They don’t deserve a single star. They will swindle money out of your pocket and run away. They have cheated me $855. My flights were cancelled, I wasn’t even informed and cancellation penalty was taken from me. The total amount paid by me is USD 4645. The cancellation penalty,as they mentioned that is USD 855 as some of the airport taxes of airlines are non-refundable. Apart from this a processing fee of USD 25 per passenger($75 in total) was charged in the booking.I received a refund of USD 3795 (loss of USD 850). Since, i am in no way responsible for cancellation, i expect a full refund. Hence, i am filing a separate case with DOT to help me get the remaining money refunded from Tripfur as they have withheld the remaining money of $850 as i never cancelled my ticket but the flights have been cancelled. The inconvenience is separate as I understand the situation and reason for cancellation but please do not show this audacity of withholding the money.",Negative

We had a family emergency with my ailing mother who passed away and booked tickets to India with them. We had all along said Dulles to Bangalore but the return ticket was extended from Dulles to SF and when we asked they said just ignore that should be no issues. Again, note the emergency we were in. When we landed back in Dulles, our suitcases never made it as those were transferred to the plane for SF. United made us pay $300 per suitcase per person. Major major scam.

The first time Ishwar Singh told me my flight has been rescheduled and he will send me a new itinerary soon. He NEVER did, also when I called again some different agent told me flight is on-time and no rescheduling is done. Clearly my flight was canceled because of coronavirus and no one in the agency new that,  I have to go to the airport to figure out what the status on my flight. Next day when I got an email from the airline regarding my flight cancelation and they mention for a possible refund because the flight was canceled by them so clearly I opt-in and request for the refund and few mins later I got an email saying ""please contact your travel agency for your possible refund"" and when I contact them they just keep on saying contact the airline for your refund even though I send them the email that I got from the airline. They just don't want to give me a refund. Seriously, they have the worst customer service I ever experienced.

606,"I ordered four international plane tickets at a cost of $4546.25 through WowFare.com. The tickets were purchased for a trip leaving April 3rd, 2020 to Germany. Due to Covid-19 (CoronaVirus), Germany was shut down and international travel was banned. We were not physically able to travel on the plane as the flight was cancelled by the airline. I contacted WowFare several times via phone with no answer between the date of Germany's closed borders and the date of the flight. On March 21st, 2020 I wrote to WowFare via E-mail because I had no success getting through with their advertised consumer service phone number. I received a response on March 22nd from WowFare saying they were giving priority to flights departing within 72 hours. And ""please reply me back 5 days before departure date, i will try to rush the situation for you"". On March 30th, I received a phone call from a representative (Todd B.) of WowFare. I was told the tickets were nonrefundable, but I could cancel the tickets for a fee of $100 and would receive a future travel credit expiring Dec 31, 2020. If I did not provide my credit card information to the representative on this phone call, I was told the tickets would not be canceled. WowFare's official policy for refunds is ""all reservations/bookings made through our website are subject to the terms and conditions of the carriage of the airline you are traveling with. All changes to your original bookings, such as refunds/cancellations, are subject to airlines terms and conditions.""  This information was given in writing on page 3 of my ticket and invoice I received from my original WowFare purchase. I have contacted both the airlines the tickets were with and was told the airlines are refunding all tickets in full. If I had booked through the airline, I would have received a full refund immediately while on the phone with Delta and United representatives. I completed a Better Business Bureau complaint against WowFare and received a form letter apologizing and saying they are still dealing with the airline in this regard. After this response, I received an e-mail from a WowFare representative (Darwin) stating I could accept a refund of $633.55/ticket. This response is in direct conflict with WowFare's official refund policy of complying with the airline's current refund policy. WowFare has not issued me any refunds. I paid an additional $100 to cancel my flights through WowFare. I have had significant difficulties contacting WowFare and receiving timely/appropriate reponses. WowFare's response to the Covid-19 situation in terms of refunding customers has been unethical and dishonest. Their actions have been in direct conflict with their official refund policy stated on my ticket/invoice.",Negative

On July 16, I received an email that the refund had been processed and the timing of the refund was dependent on my bank. Just another distract and delay tactic from this company as nothing has happened and my bank has not received anything from them. If my refund had truly been processed, as they claimed,  it would have been posted on my credit card in 3-5 business days. The email I received yesterday claims the refund could now take up to 31 days. I have been waiting since May!

609,"I bought airline tickets through Wowfare in November 2019 for a flight to Finland in June 2020. Another family was going with us. Due to covid we did not get to go on our trip and we were disappointed about that. Since the flights have been canceled by the airlines (American, British Airways, FinnAir) I would have expected to get a refund and I suppose that the airlines would have refunded our money. Well since I went through Wowfare they are not as willing as the airlines to refund money, not that any of the businesses want to refund money, but my trip being canceled was out of my control. Wowfare only wanted to refund me 60% of what I paid. That does not seem right and my friends got back 80% of what they paid. Why the difference? We paid the same exact amount at they were offered much more then we were. I was told different purchases and different refunds. Still baffled that a company like this would do that but that is what is happening. I have not heard from them in over a month. I filed a complaint with the Department of Transportation and still have not heard any thing from Wowfare. My family and I would have loved to go on our trip, it was going to be great, but now we have to sit and fight for something that was out of our control. It doesn't make sense. It would be nice to feel like i was a customer they cared about but obviously like most companies they just want the money. Feel free to use them for your flights but please no that if anything goes wrong a good portion of your money could be gone.",Negative

611,"I cancelled my trip to Europe (Switzerland) due to Covid 19. My agent is Luis. I emailed him regarding my travels way back in May and got no response. Since then I spoke to Hunter in June and Reina as recently as yesterday (Aug 6th). She kept giving me all kinds of excuses. I explained to her on numerous occasions that Wow fare is my liason to the airlines. She she knows that but she still gives me some cock and bull story. I called wow fare again today (Aug 7, 2020) and after speaking with someone in the exchange department he told me that he had to refer the matter back to Reina. Keepin mind Reina told me she was going to call me back yesterday which she didn't. Okay Wowfare game is up. While I was on hold with you I filed a claim with my credit card company and you will hear from them soon. Game is up. Buyers be aware of these clowns. I will never do business with these clowns if they are the last company on earth. You have been warned......",Negative
612,Our cruise was cancelled due to Covid so had to cancel our flights. Ruby was very helpful with processing our refund.  I wish the policy would have allowed more time to reschedule the flights so we'd not have lost any of our money paid but that had nothing to do with her service which was exceptional,Postive

614,"Wowfare is only offering me a partial refund on a trip that has been cancelled by the airlines.  I learned that they were only going to offer me what they had paid the airline, and they were keeping the difference in what I paid them and calling it a tax?  The best way to resolve this issue is to call your credit card company, and file a complaint for non delivery of services.  Thank you Capital One.  They are working on getting me a full refund.  How can someone charge for something they cannot deliver, try and keep their profit, and then try and tack on a processing fee of $100 per person.  I did not ask to have the flights ""reprocessed"".  They do not exist anymore, so give me my money back.",Negative
615,This company is THE WORST EVER!!!. Total scam. Due to Covid 19 we were unable to travel to Croatia. I called a month ahead of time to speak to someone. The pre recorded message said to call back closer to your travel dates. Feeling a bit suspicious I called Bank of America and disputed the charges. After 3 months I recieved my money back. However the scam is I recieved a letter after my flight date from someone named Pink. No last name that I would recieve 60 percent refund. I was upset and demanded 100 percent refund. I then recieved a notice that I would recieve a 100 percent refund. Again first mane only Sherry. It seemed too easy. After 2 months of inept conversations and lies i recieve 2700.00 of mt 3200 spent. The supervisors are never availableand BBB complaints are not available since they are not US based. Be very careful. Bank of america saved me. To this day I recieve fake letters saying they are workin on my refund. Yeah sure you are....,Negative
616,Thank you so much for the wonderful help to get my flight confirmed. My bank stopped the transaction on my card from going through.

617,"Highly recommend to NOT use WOWFARE!  We put in our request back in May and received email confirmation on May 26th stating it has been processed and would take 2-4 weeks to get refund and they would charge 200 per ticket for processing! We waited and nothing... Emailed and called Agent Lee on June18th, 2020.  Finally when I started posting on Facebook Agent Lee contacted us.  He tried to tell us we were out of our 120 day window to get refund back on credit card and now they have to send us check.  We bought tickets end of Feb. and definitely not out of that window and also found out that airline already refunded them back!  I called again last week. Couldn’t get agent Lee and talked to another guy and said it had been processed to accounting and would have to wait on them to cut the check! I asked how long that would take and he said he didn’t know and to be patient because they are dealing with millions of people in the same boat!  BUT we have already received 100% back from Celebrity Cruises and they deal with millions of people as well and we got it back directly to credit card we used! It is Friday, July 24th and still no email stating check has been Mailed! Highly disappointing to be out over 3,000.00 including tipping our agent!",Negative

619,"I wish I could give Wowfare a separate rating from the agent who helped me.  Calvin was our travel agent and he was amazing!  He deserves five plus stars.  He was responsive and very polite.  Anytime I emailed him, he would respond within 24 hours.  He called several times too.  This was nice because I was able to place a voice and a person to the many emails I received.  I believe Calvin is solely responsible for getting us our refund.  If you use Wowfare and are lucky enough to work with Calvin, you will be fine.  He will take very good care of you and your travel companions! Wowfare, on the other hand, is not so wonderful.  Although we got our refund, we did not receive the full amount.  We were charged $200 per person.  Since we bought seven tickets, we were out $1400 when all was said and done.  This is Wowfare""s  policy, according to them.

I only found out my flight was cxl from the airlines, WOWFARE never notified me. WOWFARE states they're following airlines policies regarding refund amounts.  That's all lies.  Airlines have refunded money to WOWFARE.  This business delays refunds in the hopes that you'll forget about it or tired of waiting on line 30 min and never getting a response. Ive spoken with Bella Anderson, Irene, Alton, Jeramy Megan ALL are scam artist. Nice on the phone but NO RESULTS. After several months, I got an email from Alton stating my refund has been approved they needed my credit card to refund it, then they needed my address because the electronic system was down and my check was on its way.  Now, it's going on 8 months. Ive filed a BBB complaint and WOWFAREs response was ""were working hard on your refund"". It sounds like a ""FAMILY"" rip off business, next I'm getting a lawyer.

But that first year wasn't a waste at all, as there were many trips I was interested in and I thoroughly enjoyed contemplating different excursions! Finally though I booked two trips this year.  The first I booked in February for this October and it is near and dear to my heart, as I booked my wife and I on a trip back to Greece, where we honeymooned 25 years ago!  This is particularly important to me because I took one of my daughters to Athens, Mykonos and Santorini two years ago and just simply fell in love with those two islands.  I soooo wanted Barbara with us then, but now she and I will be able enjoy it. From a practical point of view, Next Vacay was wonderful because the ticket price was so cheap (under $400) that I opted for an upgraded seats and insurance.  And now with covid issues, if the trip is canceled, I will still be reimbursed. The second trip I booked in May for January 2021 and it is to my wife's favorite place, Aruba and we are taking our 3 adult daughters.

But upon contacting them, the customer service was very quick to answer and to find me a solution on time. Since i landed at the airport quite late at night, I also appreciated that the company contacted by ""My Transfers"" followed me up (thru whatsapp) with clear instructions and step by step messages up to the meeting point with the driver (due to coronavirus restrictions, the meeting point was outside the airport: no meets and greets at arrival hall). In both journeys, the assigned car was a 7 seats type just for me. As far as i could see, they were clean and in good shape.

I was then told that my flight had been canceled because they had not confirmed my ticket numbers with them so they had to cancel it.

I never received a check, so I emailed back they said that it was forwarded to another department for them to look into it and i had to wait more time.

I expressed concerns about being able to bring a carry on bag and have a similar seat assignment now that they switched my airline. Vance Victor (the representative) emailed me many times assuring me that they would email confirmation of my seats and ability to bring a carry on. It is now 3 days before my trip and he has not responded to any emails within the last month. nor do I have a seat assignment or information saying they paid for a carry on bag. This is a scam!!! In the receipt from United it states that this was $100 cheaper for this flight than the American Airline flight (which is what I paid to Shiva). This is why they switched me.

Tracking number shows returned to sender immediately. I went through their review process that was emailed to me. No response. I emailed them. Still no response. All dates have come and gone, their web page says the order was filled and I have nothing and they have my money. They seem to be aware of their online reviews, so maybe I can get some answers by telling others about my experience. My only recourse after this is to report the fradulent charges to my card. Either way, I don't recommend them. Anyone can see from their reviews that this has been an ongoing issue for this company. I should have checked before I ordered. UPDATE: I received an email on the 12th, stating they reached out to me with a new shipping date after the order was returned to them. This is absoluely not true. I received an email April 28th stating the order would be shipped out on the 8th. April 29th I received an email with a tracking number which ultimately was returned to the sender on the 30th.

I didn't open any of the packages as I wanted to return them. I emailed SkyGeek, explained the problem, and got a quick response from ""Sarah"" in their Help Center. After checking with the warehouse, Sarah asked me to open one of the packages to see if what appeared to be several O-Rings was actually one large O-Ring that had been folded on itself to fit in the package. Problem solved - what appeared to be several small O-Rings was actually the correct MS29513-260 (used to seal the plexiglass cover of an MU-2's tail and strobe lights) which had been folded to fit into the small package.

We were flying three families home from the Caribbean as things became serious with COVID-19 and some of our commercial flights were being cancelled, this was essentially a repatriation flight.

My truck window was smashed in the non covered parking area the first and ONLY time I will ever use this place. From what I could tell multiple cars were smash and grabbed that day (still 6-7 cars in the lot with bags over their windows spread out so who knows how many people already got their smashed cars in the week I was gone). One of the robbers LOST TWO EARRINGS in my truck. Basically, this took some time to hit that many cars. They opened my console and pulled the stuff out. Opened my glove box and pulled the stuff out, somehow got two earrings caught in the back of the driver seat and then left the back seat of my truck up. There is no way a million car alarms were not going off. The person on duty when we got back was apologetic and told us she'd refund us for unused days (we booked 14 and used 7 because we rushed home due to coronavirus) and had us fill out insurance forms knowing damn well, they dont refund for unused days and that their insurance doesnt cover the uncovered parking section. (The fine print is key people.) Well played WallyPark, you really screwed us. To top it off, this was my farm truck with literally nothing but a pack of gum and a small thing of hand sanitizer in it.

When I got to the pay booth, I politely said that you should increase your staff because I had been waiting for 15 min. The attendant was very rude and said that it was the fault of the other customers in front of me because their cards took a long time to process. So, I said, ""well, then you should get more staff and open the other booth if your credit card system is slow."" She said, ""no, we are fine how we are.""

He even said ""ma'am just go away"" ?? I get it if I was rude... But waiting for 8mths and that's your response?!?!? Bye. Hopefully they will be bankrupt!",Negative
894,"Firstly they have a nasty attitude when talking to them! They should not be in customer service if they can’t talk to people. My flight was cancelled by the air line. I contact the air line directly and they said they are giving FULL refunds due to COVID19. I Contacted Explore trip. My family tickets total is $4032.68. Explore trip decided to do me a big ""favour"" to allow them to give me a partial refund is $3232.68 which is about $800 less that what I paid for.  The reason they charge the $800 is for the “TAX”. WHAT TAX? I haven’t go anywhere yet! This is such a nightmare when I’m only ask for my own money back. BIG Scam!!!",Negative
895,"Is been more than 3 months Still no response.﻿ Poor Customer Service.

You can Google it by searching: ""aviation consumer protection refunds"" And I’ve been waiting since May 2020.. still no answer I just want this to be resolved. Poor Customer Service, one of their Agents was very rude and won’t listened me. He don’t care about helping out or at least trying, his name I think is Bret or Brad then he was mocking me talking very slowly on purpose very unprofessional also request him to communicate with his supervisor and he denied it very rude and zero communication and customer service skills. Regarding the refund I’ve been working it out since May and haven’t been able to solve anything in two+ months understanding the Pandemic and the difficult times we’re living. Is frustrating already try the airline and the told me to call the travel agency and vice versa.. definitely one of the worst experiences ever, the last agent I call at least was trying and in very professional manners told me that he sent an email requesting the airline to sent the refund. I’m very frustrated with this experience I know it could be better.",Negative

Never use these scammers!!",Negative
898,"This company is absolutely terrible. I want to write this so no one will use them. If you're reading this, please don't be enticed by their cheap prices - they are not worth it!! Firstly, after we booked, we were super excited. Flying from Bangkok to the US return. This was at the end of 2019, coming back in Feb 2020. After booking, I was called at 3 in the morning, for them to inform me that they are going to charge an extra fee to my card for something that I can't even remember. They did not give us an option, if we wanted to fly, they had to charge us this, and it was like $50 EACH. (And out of all the times I called them, THIS was my most pleasant experience talking to them on the phone.) Everything for our first flight was fine, our tickets were legit, and we made it to America. Then the poop hits the fan when Coronavirus started. This was when it had just started. SO all the flights from the airline we were flying get cancelled, including ours. Ok, no big deal we just need to reschedule or get a refund, right? No. Not easy when no one answers their customer service number. And anyone that does, doesn't know what to do! Explore trip explained to us how it's ""not their fault"" and they can't refund us that we have to go through the airline. China eastern says we have to get a refund through the third party site we booked through (explore trip). We finally got on to someone (after calling 4-5 times) who said he would submit a request to the airline from them for a refund for us. They then assured us completely that within 2-3 months (a ridiculously long time anyways) we would get at least a partial refund. One lady said she needed to make our case as ""completed"" in order to request a new case of the partial refund. (We didn't have a choice in this.) You can imagine the next time we called they could see nothing in their files about our case. I feel the need to stress how bad their customer service is. Very hit or miss. One or two times we had a friendly Indian guy. EVERY OTHER TIME IT WAS HELL. I waited on hold for hours - legitimate hours. I got hung up on multiple times. And I got told there was nothing in the system about my case. Well as you know, it's August 2020 now. I have still not received any refund. I had to book another flight out of the US, costing me more money - I did that through a different site, which is what I should've done in the first place. I have now given up on the $1000 that they stole from us. I would literally recommend walking to your desired destination before working with these criminals.",Negative

They will not let you speak to a supervisor. The say the supervisor is busy and they will call you back in 24 hours, but you will never get a call back.

908,"About a year ago, Explore Trip had sold numerous tickets with Jet Airways, an airline which went bankrupt last April. Ever since its insolvency, Explore trip has not issued a refund to the customers including myself. In fact, I found out about the insolvency within 48 hours prior to my flight by myself. There was no email notifying customers about the insolvency upon the incidence, no backup plans, and no effort to resolve the issue. When I called them to inquire about the issue, they responded: ""well its good that you found out now instead of finding it out at the airport."" Despite the fact that my flight was leaving within 48 hours, the person on the phone could not provide a solution or an alternative. He asked me to send an email, and told me “they will probably get back to you within 48 hours…” I waited for 24 hours and couldn’t wait anymore so I canceled my flight with them entirely and re-booked my trip with Expedia. I have been contacting them via phone and email back and forth for more than a year now, and they only keep telling me that “they are working on it, please be patient…” It has been over a year! Are they waiting to a point that they are no longer reliable? Jet Airways is non-existent now. I spent $678.26 on the original flight with Explore Trip and an extra $930 for the last minute booking. I have waited too long to reach out to my credit card company and the dispute period is 3 months; however, my transaction was made over a year ago. Does anyone know if there is any way to get my money back? Is taking legal action the only way now? Hope you all are safe and well, and DO NOT BOOK WITH EXPLORE TRIP.

However, my friend's flight was canceled on 4/16 by the same airlines too and received her refund from another OTA in 7 weeks. So I don't think this problem is on airlines. They most likely lied.

915,"Horrible experience. I hate using third parties to buy any kind of tickets, but my little sister did not have a lot of experience and when found Bravofly's offer she thought it was a great deal. She booked 2 two-way Ryanair flight tickets through Bravofly and bought the ""flexible"" option, which is advertised as if it would allow passengers to change or modify their booking up until 24 hours before the departure with no extra change fee. But when we actually wanted to do it (in this case due to Covid19) their website sent us to Ryanair's official site where they wanted to charge 200€ extra change fee. We tried to contact Bravofly through phone but they were almost unreachable. After 19 calls and alltogether more than 1,5 hours (!!) of waiting on hold, we were finally able to talk to them and request the change without extra charges (as promised according to their own ""Flexible flight"" conditions). After a day of waiting for response they sent an email saying that for the fare we purchased, changes of the flight tickets are not permitted by Ryanair, therefore our booking remains unchanged. Unless we want to pay the 200€ extra for the change, of course.. This means Bravofly sold and charged a great amount of extra money for the ""flexible"" option, when that option NEVER existed according to Ryanair's terms and conditions. How can they even offer the flexible option for tickets that are NOT flexible?? Now we have lost all 4 tickets and will have to pay the huge phone bill too.

However and I wish I knew this before: if your flight gets cancelled by the airline it is the airline that has to arrange for the new flight so call them directly.

929,"Another bravofly / lastminute.com horror story. The company cancelled  both my flights (out and return - booked as single trip tickets). I contacted them 2 months prior to departure and they would ""contact me"" as soon as they had made new flights. I waited a month, called them back. Same answer. Waited a few days. Same answer no contact were made. Since they had cancelled my flight and told my every time i called that i could always request a refund, which because of the covid-19 would be a maximum of 15 weeks. I thought everything was fine, they would cancel my flight and a refund would come by at a latee point.. So i booked new tickets with the airline company Received two check-in messages today. Called the other company (SAS). The flight was never cancelled, and they could do nothing with the ticket booked from bravofly.. So i called bravofly again in the morning with the answer ""don't worry, you will hear from us later today, as it is our prioity when it is this close tl departue"".. Called them in the evening, and insisted to get a confirmation before hanging up - result was the indian sounding supporter hanged up on me, saying that they would contact me. SAS are able to cancel the booking instantly when contacted about it - their support told me. They are NOT legit. Worst customer experience in my life. Would never recommend this company or lastminute.com who i also called with same response + a hefty phone bill, because of a massive queue, no action from support, and not a free number in London. The danish caller number does not exist anymore, so this is the only option for calling them..",Negative

959,***Update*** The advice provided in response to my review is incorrect as the baggage allowance you claim WizzAir allow is incorrect and they only allow 40x30x20 (not 55x40x23 as you claim). This is something you really need to correct as we were out of pocket for what would have been a minor additional expense had we known better. *** Seems like an excellent service but we were blindsided by extra luggage costs. All our flights on easy jet gave us a typical cabin bag but with WizzAir it was not made clear that we needed to upgrade this. In the end it led to issues boarding and a £50 bill. Be very cautious when using this website without first double checking the Terms and Conditions of the carrier. To Flyhacks I say that you need to incorporate these prices and provide greater detail as clearly the cheaper prices you claim to offer are not accurate.,Negative
960,"Run away from this company!! Once you book with them they will overcharge you for any extra you need: luggage, seat, etc. In our case we needed a priority board with Ryanair that costs between 6 and 8 euros and they charged us 19. Good that we didn't need to check-in any luggage!",Negative
961,"I am not used to complaining but my first experience with Flyhacks make me absolutely angry. I bought a flight (with one connection between) that it was saying that include 2 luggage (10 kg). When I receive my boarding pass, it was specific that I could have just a small personal bag that fits under the seat. If I wanted more I needed to spend more 20 pounds per usual trolley and it would end it up to 40 pounds because I do a change/connection so it is considered 2 travels. It all would be fine if the company clearly explained the luggage terms correctly. I don't think ""hand luggage (10kg) should be the term used for a small personal bag that fits under the seat. I just realise one day before my flight that I can't have basically any luggage. So frustrating when I paid a lot for this flight",Postive

This company was extremely difficult to get a refund processed through, even after all the mandates, laws, and even airlines saying they would offer full refunds to anyone, regardless of the ticket type. I had one international flight fully canceled by the airline, and a schedule change that would have changed a 2 hour layover into a 10 hour layover, as well as another schedule change that added a stop to my 1-stop return (ignoring the fact that I couldn't even travel from Europe to this city due to new flight restrictions). Even after this, it still took multiple demands and emails to get someone to process a refund for my family. That was June 23 and now its August 10. I still don't have my $3500 airfare refund on my credit card (Also, this was not the total fare amount I was initially shown, I was quoted a higher fare, which turned out to be full of service fees). I will NEVER use this company again, and probably not any other 3rd party booking company that does not disclose the amount of fees upfront. I will probably be out $500 of ""service fees"" that I will have to go through my credit card company to try and recover.",Negative
987,"COVID related.   When all of this started, I called the company to learn what our options were.  At that time, the representative advised that we could cancel our reservation, but that would cost us a penalty. He also stated that, if the flights were cancelled, we could call in for a full refund.  Because of this, I decided to wait until the cancellation. Our flight to Europe in July was cancelled at the end of June.  When I found this out (through my own research), I called the company and was advised that I could get a refund or a credit on a future flight, but had to have the voucher redeemed by January 2021.  Since I didn’t know when the concerts that we were going to would be rescheduled, I opted for the refund even though they advised that the reimbursement would take up to 90 days.  At the time, no mention was made of fees that would be taken out.  Today, I got the following email: In regards to your reservation, you can either get a refund of $1810.44 or else future credit for the paid amount valid for 2 years from the date of purchase which can be used to rebook an international trip to Europe. Kindly decide and let us know to proceed further.

So skybooker reaching out via social media since you refuse to respond to my emails or take and return my calls. WHY did you cancel my flight without my permission? Also, since i never gave you permission to cancel my flight where is my money? Why should i have to pay fees when you cancelled my flight without communicating that i wouldn't get a full refund? i was trying to get a travel voucher but they wanted to charge me another $1000 to use my voucher. but if i went online and booked on there site it was actually $80 less then the voucher? they never explained to me why i had to pay another $1000 to use my travel credit of $1474.90. They ignored me and  cancelled my flight made ME pay fees when i gave them no permission to cancel my flight. Maybe Skybooker will do the right thing and refund me all my money you owe me which is $1,020.

The amount quoted  as a fee on each of the 8 tickets we bought was way more than we were willing to loose. After arguing over the phone we finally got to talk to a ""manager"", who told us that a calculation error had been made, and that the amount deducted was less. We were also told that it was because they had to pay fees to the Airline that the amount was deducted. Interestingly enough, the same procedure happened to our daughter, when she asked for her full refund. We feel that we got lied to and would not trust Skybooker again.

My biggest issue here is that we have called Skybooker on at least 5 occasions and you had no idea what was going on.  Insisting a week from our flight date that our flight was not cancelled when the airline canceled months prior.  You are at the minimum disorganized.  The 25% fee you are taking off our refund as your ""service fee"" had zero service behind it.  It took a three way call set up by me for you to finally acknowledge that our flight had been cancelled.

I got back in touch and told them what Lufthansa had said and received the response that it was not them but Lufthansa who had cancelled and that they would look into it with their refund department. Weeks later, with further emails sent, I have received nothing. Apart from the Lufthansa fiasco, Jet 2 cancelled their leg, months ago, refunded me my seat cost immediately, as I had paid this separately and told me they would refund the flight. I told Sky-tours who said they would deal with it, and to send all the Jet 2 paperwork to them. What a surprise, I have not received that money also. This company may think it is getting away with this in the short term, however if they continue this way, they will have no company in the long-term, as who would be able to trust them.",Negative

You must have policies for refunds specifying the maximum time it will take?? I won’t wait until Christmas, or until next Easter, that would be a breach of customer rights. The airlines have told me that they do not have any of my money because they sent it back to Sky-tours....! Still NOTHING.

Instead they blamed American Airlines, saying that they would only provide vouchers. I am so disappointed with the service as it was sky tours that I gave my money to, not American Airlines, and sky tours should be responsible for returning my money. I will be contacting the Civil Aviation Authority about this company.",Negative

The Customer Service is third-party and they will never help you figure solutions other than the options they already offer you when your travel is cancelled. WORST WEBSITE. Don't waste your money with them.

I wish I read these reviews before. I called kiwi the morning of our flight (as we were asked not to contact them beforehand). I was told that I would have to contact the airline directly for our refund (1000+). Naturally, I reached out to the airline & was advised that due to the global circumstances, they will be providing approval for all monetary refunds through the original booking agency. Kiwi had a refund center which guaranteed me 10 euros (GENEROUS RIGHT?!) or I could PAY for priority refunds... which I did bc who knew if I was going to be in a terrible situation due to the pandemic. Fast forward- 4 months. Still no refund. I log onto my account to see that my refund was denied as the airline was not providing. I called the airline & had a woman stay on the line with me to connect with a kiwi rep... after speaking with us for 3 mins the line mysteriously was disconnected... the airline rep said she’ll wait for a new rep as I called again. I had to stop counting the “um” after 50.... he was so useless... looped in his manager who said he could authorize a review of my refund request but due to the pandemic & backlog he was unsure how long it would take to get back to me... assuming they must be extremely caught up because I heard back in 2 hours!!!!! Denied AGAIN! This time because my flight was “never cancelled” and I am marked as traveled! HA! From Athens to NJ in May! Wow. I’m just stunned. Disgusted. And embarrassed for this company.

Most people won’t be able to claim that voucher, because many won’t want to fly this year (to Spain of all places).

I remark that article 8(c) says they should provide rescheduling at a convenient time for me (Article 5.2 says they should also provide alternatives which they didn't). 5) They respond that the agency should contact them and not me.

1089,"This used to be a very pleasant airline to fly with, but now we have had such dreadful experiences with them recently.     Here are 3: 1. 	We plan to travel as a family of 4 to the United States in October 2020, flying Geneva-Munich-New York, and returning New York-Brussels-Geneva.   The flight New York-Brussels is a Brussels Airlines/UA flight on October 24.    We purchased the ticket online via a German travel agent. Recently, we received an email from Brussels Airlines indicating that the New York-Brussels leg of the trip had been cancelled. Despite extensive and repeated efforts on our part -- and despite very clear European Union rules in this area --, Brussels Airlines refuses to rebook us on another flight. They consistently argue that the travel agent should rebook us.  However, the travel agent will charge us a rebooking fee of 49 EUR per person, a total of 196 EUR for a 4-person family. The European Union rules are unequivocal that the airline is responsible for rebooking.    Brussels Airlines avoids all responsibility. 2.    	A second matter concerns 7 travel legs cancelled by Brussels Airlines during the period of confinement March-June 2020, for which I am seeking reimbursement.  Brussels Airlines has sent me on a repeated loop, in which the website tells me I need to contact them via Facebook or Twitter, and then Facebook tells me I need to make this request ""via the website"".   Again the EU rules are clear:   Brussels Airlines is obliged to reimburse.  To date it appears that they are exclusively focused on avoiding their legal obligations. 3.     	In July 2019, we flew to the US on a direct flight Brussels-New York on a saturday.  Brussels Airlines did not manage to put our luggage on the plane.    As our girls were starting camp on Monday, we were forced to buy replacement items on the Sunday.  Our luggage arrived Monday.

They first told yes and that it will cost me, I said no problem!! Only for them to tell me later that they will not be able to add it and that my only solution was to cancel my ticket and that they will refund my money....later on they told me NO!

We went to complain and the official Croatian Airlines staff were rude and didnt care at all. In the end they ended up calling the police on us since we were angry they loaded people on a defective plane. Some fat slob and toothless officer came yelling at us saying he will arrest us?! They said "" we can only know the plane is broken when in the air"".... Wth?!? Never again with Croatian Airlines. And never again summer vacation in Croatia.

They didn't even bother asking the booking number or last name, just keep repeating that you need to ""wait a little bit"". How long is a little bit, Brussel Airlines?

1105,Like many other reviewers I am finding applying for a refund impossible. First keep calling the call centre and being  told to try later. After a few weeks a recorded message says press 1 to book a new flight or 2 for a refund. After selecting 2 a recorded message directs you back to the website to fill in a claim. First the booking reference and name. Click continue then a message On the screen says we cannot locate your flight please call the call centre!!! Obviously set up to make it look like  refunds are being offered when they clearly are not. As they only give 3 months from the flight date to apply they don’t have to continue their farce for long. I have since read they are close to bankruptcy and were already having financial difficulties prior to Covid. As are their parent company Lufthansa. So looks like we are all unlikely to see our money again. Thank you N for publishing the information about complaints.

The representative at the Munich airport ( this happened in split) was appalled at what had happened to us and assured us that we were treated wrongly and to issue a complaint against Croatia airlines.

That's 800€. I was assured once in Vienna I will be refunded for the new ticket and the 24h!!!! delay. Guess what. They lied. I have been in a legal battle with them for the past 6 month. Their costumer support is taught to never ever accept refunds and keep you on thd telephone line so you pay (2€/minute) untill you have a huge mobile bill and have to cut the connection. Sending you from one service member to the other. The customer service also lied multiple times about handling the issue. They wanted to postpone it long enough to forfeit my right for legal action. Which I noticed and contacted my lawyer. As of today they owe me 1.600 euros as refund for the new tickets and refund for the tickets they canceled. It was the 7th Jan. and Istanbul Airport was a sh*tshow. The people Pegasus refused, a couple of hundred were getting Realy angry. What did Pegasus do?

1153,"I wouldn't give any star, if option existed. They are without fear of contradiction the worse possible airline and customer service in the industry. From my experience, the only two characteristics they are good at, is taking your money and being grossly incompetent. I flew a year ago and they beseeched me with emails for months about how safe we will be once we book again and we can delay flying once a ticket was booked for two years. They even had videos. It was relentless. Then I booked a flight to Zanzibar. They cancelled the flight to Zanzibar from Kuwait that was going to be 11 hours duration at short notice and rebooked one that would have me wait at Hamad Airport in Doha 19 hours.I had to beg for food. No accommodation. The food was from one of the cheap places at the airport and I wasn't even allowed pure orange juice. It had to be the sugary water-laden variety. There were Business Lounges available with no one using, but I couldn't use those. I had to walk around and sit on chairs and spend money to buy hot drinks to keep warm because the AC is freezing like the North Pole. Having landed at 0515 and departing 0110, you feel close to hypothermic by then. But of course they don't care, they've already banked your money. On the way back I booked another 24 hour + journey and a $300 upgrade to Business class - mainly because they have you wearing these huge face shields that makes you feel claustrophobic and can't breathe properly for however long the flights are. It's the air filtration system and distance seating on the flights that is more effective, but that will costs money and  they want to give the impression they are a safe airline to fly with while almost suffocating you to death at 35000 feet. The day before the Zanzibar to Nairobi leg of the journey, it was cancelled by Kenya Airways. No suggestions from Kenya Airways about alternative ways to make the other journeys, worse, no update or contact from Qatar Airways. You would think that someone in their customer service would send a message via email or call and say, sorry again, but your're not going to make the Nairobi flight to then go on to Doha because Kenya isn't allowing Tanzanian flights into Kenya. Some local tiff, but Qatar who took my money doesn't think any of it has anything to do with them so - no contact. Luckily, a friend with time could wait one hour and 23 minutes on a call and managed to change the booking so I can fly - now a day earlier, so that's $70 wasted on accommodation. And no mention of the additional upgrade refund I paid for because I am I am not flying in an upgraded seat. However, I can now fly from Zanzibar to Doha and onto Kuwait. Arrived at airport only to be asked by Qatar Airways staff who have now morphed into immigration officers, perhaps another talent other than being incompetent. If I had a resident permit to go to Kuwait. Apparently you are not allowed to go to Kuwait at this time if you don't have a resident permit, this is fine. It is their rule. But why are they selling tickets to UK nationals if their final destination is Kuwait, I asked. ""They might have permits"", Kalunde Kasiga (ASDO ) says. She is in the Zanzibar office and takes great pleasure in seeing passengers flight plans thrown into chaos by her airline. ""Please could you call someone and ask them to transfer the money I have paid so I can get a flight to London?"" ""I can't do that"", she says abruptly, ""my hands are tied"", and hands me a leaflet with information on where I can complain. ""Why can't you call and ask someone to help me. You are an employee, aren't you?"" It's not her job to help find anywhere I can stay for the night or do refunds. All of this could be avoided if on the website at the time of booking, they flagged a notice warning customers without permits for Kuwait not to book. This of course would mean losing money as less people would book flights and they are not bad  at that, it's the only thing they're good at!  So they let you book, interrogate you at the airport, bar you from boarding and just abandon you. If you have no money to find accommodation or a taxi that's not their problem. When asked about a refund she says it takes 7 to 14 working days. Airlines like Qatar Airways have always been poor with shoddy customer service. Assuring you that you can complain and passing you from pillar to post and making you pay huge phone charges waiting for someone to answer at their customer service. None of the customer numbers - if you can find them - are free, so if you are outside your country; and waiting hours for a response, it costs a tidy sum. Now due to Covid-19 they can hide behind the mask of this gross uncoordinated lacklustre performance as not being their fault. Hopefully, we will be back to near normal at some time in the future with more choice, but I wouldn't use them again. They are not fit for purpose.",Negative

Pegasus is making up their own rules, ignoring governmental regulations during Covid crisis and doesn't help people at all. They are just looking for their profit. I’m fighting since March to get my money back for a flight they denied my partner and me boarding - without a valid reason.  During Covid crisis, we were both still allowed to enter our final destination, had several documents which showed that we are residents and live there, showed them governmental entry requirements and still they didn't let us enter. They didn’t even try to check if that was possible, they just decided to deny us boarding because of our nationality. After spending 3 hours at their desk at the airport (the first 1.5 hours waiting for someone to come), and with no offer from their side for an alternative flight back to our final destination, we had to book a new flight with another airline which of course let us fly - just confirming with the destination’s airport if we had the conditions required to land. Also, during this odyssey Pegasus lost my luggage for several days and still until now I don't have any answer about the lost luggage refund either. I have no words for this kind of incompetence and I'm more than furious about this company. If you would like to take a flight to your chosen destination, better don’t count on Pegasus.",Negative

Turkish Airlines then said that if I want to fly on the 1pm flight then I will need to pay for the change of flight. I am stuck in between two airlines pointing fingers and this is not fair to me. I just need a time to be confirmed with both airlines and have my correct ticket issued so that I can fly.

Highly highly highly recommend to stay away by far the worse experience I’ve had and this isn’t even a cheap airline. I’ve travelled on far less expensive flights that have been 10x better. Regarding refunds, my ticket was for early March before lockdowns and despite calling Turkish numerous times to confirm the flight was still happening, they cancelled it on the day! I didn’t mind this as it was a global pandemic, however once I requested a refund they told me to wait 2 weeks at first, then 30 days and then no response! It is now July (5/6 months later) and I have still not got my refund! For reference other family members of mine got tickets with Qatar and within they got their refunds within 14 days.

If you did number 1 and filed a claim with the insurance company they MAY refund the deposit.

China is in its second wave of outbreak for god sake, and no one can be sure how safe it will be to travel... especially within the time frame of the voucher, but I digressed.

They have no concern or regard for human life, our health or safety and even had the nerve to try and make it seem like we were canceling for something other than the PANDEMIC that is currently affecting our lives. They gave every reason in the book to justify, but what they are doing to people is just WRONG!!! They even suggested that we gift the voucher when we originally planned the trip for our anniversary 🤔...

1239,"Hello, It is really unfortunate that Vacation Express would jeopardize the health and safety of their customers.  We recently booked a trip to Mexico through our travel agent who uses your packages...Considering the health risk posed to travelers right now due to Covid19, you would assume that there would be some relief from the current bookings, however, we just learned that we would be 100% penalized for making an educated decision not travel during this time to one protect ourselves, our families, our co-workers, and communities.  The CDC even recommends not traveling if it is not necessary, a vacation express vacation is not necessary. This decision is unbelievable and I am sure we are not the only customers who are outraged by this decision, which will ultimately cost you more in the long run due to your lack of concerns for your customers.  Our communication will not end with this inquiry, we will let everyone know the decisions you have made, the risks you are posing to customers and how you are treating our financial investment.

I asked again so we would have enough time to get them if we needed them, he still said no. So my husband and I brought our passports and their birth certificates and ID’s. We went to the airport to check in at the Vacation Express counter and they told us we could not travel without their passports. I explained what I was told, and she told me there was nothing they could do and I should call their customer service number. So I called and called and called. I asked for a supervisor, left multiple messages, and finally got a call back 3 weeks after we were suppose to have had our vacation. She told me “you should have known better.” She said they would not rebook our vacation, they would not credit us anything or refund us anything. She said even if she could do anything, it was 3 weeks after I booked the vacation. I told her, “because you took 3 weeks to call me back!” She was extremely rude and provided zero customer service or just simple manners. We left the airport on the day we were suppose to go to the Dominican Republic with everyone in tears because Vacation Express gave us inaccurate information. And then lied about it. I will never book with Vacation Express again and I will make sure I relay this to everyone I know. The unprofessional woman I spoke to at Vacation Express was Terry at extension 44267.

1244,"Traveled the same trip with Franklin Taverras (a previous review) to Jamaica from Newark.  The flights were disastrous, like nothing I have ever experienced.  I wouldn't be surprised if they violated FAA guidelines.  We lost an entire day traveling.  Have you ever traveled on a plane that had a mechanic onboard?  Me either until our trip with  vacation express.  They offered us $100 credit through our agent, who was also inept.  I have sent dozens of emails to VE and have called and tried to speak to someone but to no avail.  The was a group trip of 10, 5 of leaving from Newark.  We spent over $1500 pp.  At least the resort was nice.  Too bad, we lost a day of vacationing there.",Negative
1245,"A credit for $100 for what I spent and had to endure is a slap in the face. I spent entirely to much money and asked to be moved. Not only did I not get moved, my phone didn’t work, my air conditioning barely worked, vomit in the pool, unswimable beach, nasty seaweed and unkept beach, harassing staff, staff always in our room, felt unsafe and spent way more than we ever intended so we could be off the resort. Vacation Express totally misrepresented this property and suckered  me. They said it was a 3.5-4 star resort. No way! The pictures you portray are completely not accurate. One of the worst resorts I’ve ever visited. You offering a $100 credit for 3 people doesn’t even cover the baggage fees I paid. Ridiculous is all I can say. You should be ashamed to take people’s money and be so misleading Their answer after nearly two months is absurd.",Negative

1252,"After waiting patiently for half a year on a refund and speaking to 3 different support agents, this is the kind of service you get from AirAsia. I did not save the conversations from the last 2 agents nor remember their names because I was trying to give this company the benefit of the doubt. However, that was my mistake. After a false promise on prioritizing the refund the first time and another false promise that someone would be getting back to me by email the second time, none of the first 2 agents kept their word. The 3rd agent kept giving me the same response that he/she had followed up. I demanded that if I don't receive a refund by this week, I will file a dispute and contact the bank. The agent had responded extremely rudely as if I had said something to offend him/her personally. Now, if AirAsia reads the full conversation I had with this 3rd agent, the company will find the I hadn't said anything bad or inappropriate to him/her but I was treated like this anyway; Like a piece of garbage. Truly sad and unacceptable really. Noone deserves to be treated this way. I know this because I myself work in the field of hospitality and never in my whole life have I gotten this kind of service quality. If you take your job personally and can't separate your emotions from your job, you should change careers. Given that I've hidden this person's identity shows that I am respectful. Half a year out of pocket and all you get is a super rude attitude from someone who's supposed to be helping you. Please do better AirAsia.

So even though my refund is only half of what I paid, that also apparently includes the value of the points I used? What a huge scam.

I went through their virtual advisor as that is the only way to contact them now as they don’t answer their phone anymore and applied for a refund on the 18th of March 2020.

1263,"We was super excited about going on this vacation. We named it “Baby Moon” as a pre vacation before we have our baby boy. On Saturday, July 13th at the Newark Airport, we were schedule to leave at 8am arriving in Jamaica at 11:35 AM. We were delayed for 30 minutes then boarded the plane and was delayed for an hour on the plane with little to no air conditioned, because the toilets were backed up or there was waste issues with the plane. After about 2 hours, everyone was boarded, and the flight was about to take off and something was wrong with one of wings on the plane. All passengers were deplaned and we was about 3 to 4 hours delayed, then 5 hours. The mechanic told everyone including the flight agents “We are flying to Miami and then taking another plane to Jamaica.” At that moment we became annoyed and uncomfortable flying with Swift Air. Be mindful, my girlfriend is 7 months pregnant. The trip was a nightmare that never ended. The whole  time we had the mechanic on the plane with us. I never heard of the mechanic  flying on a plane with the passengers. After 5 hours of delay, we flew to Miami arriving there at 4:30 PM. In Miami, we had an hour and half to spare before boarding the plane to leave to Jamaica. My girlfriend was hungry, we had to buy food at the Miami International Airport. We were supposed to be in Jamaica by that time, eating and enjoying the sun by the pool and myself with a cocktail in hand. We flew out of Miami at 6:00 PM and arrived at Jamaica at 8:30 PM, got on the bus only to wait another30 minutes for everyone to get on it. We was the last stop on the bus and arrived at 10:30 pm at Royal Decameron Resort. About 11 hours later then when we were supposed arrive. The hotel at Royal Decameron resort was ok, we lost electricity a lot during the day and a few times at night. No electricity means no AC, so a hot room was super uncomfortable. Also, the excursion representative was late for our meeting. The person that picked us up to head to the airport was early and a bit rude. On July 19th on our way back home, the transportation was early because the paperwork said 12:30 PM to pick up passengers. The Sunwing paper at the hotel said pickup was at 12:55 PM. Good thing we was passing by the lobby because otherwise he was going to leave without us and others. I felt like they didn’t care or didn’t have the right information or we didn’t receive the right information . I think you (America Express) lack communications with us as customers and the people who work for Sunwing or Vacation Express in Jamaica. At the airport in Jamaica, we was told that the plane arrived and it’ll be 30 minutes before we can board. After that half hour, we boarded the plane, and it super-hot, humid in the plane. After an hour of sitting there in the plane with my pregnant girlfriend who almost passed out, the pilot say “One of the tires pressure is low, sit tight the rounds crew is coming to put hydrogen air on the tire. If the air doesn’t hold, we will be deplaned and replace the tire” Thinking to myself, here we go again Seriously! And my nightmare continues. The tire was able to hold to air and we tool off to Newark arriving at 11PM instead of 9:55 PM.  Overall, we are super unhappy/disappointed with this trip. Swift Air should be out of business, super uncomfortable seatings and hot and humid planes. We would never travel with Swift Air again, that is a promise and I’ll make sure to tell people about our experience. I would like for you guys to gives each a voucher using another airline for the miserable trip we encounter last week,  because it wasn’t a pleasant experience by far.

I will NEVER use Singapore Airlines. This was a one-off holiday to Singapore to see some Rugby and SA have ensured I won't be resurrecting this particular holiday once things are close to normal again.

So I could be up waiting up to 6 months my my reckoning. They owe me nearly £4,000 for cancelled flights. Why can't they be automatically refunded when they are cancelled if that's what the customer wants? They are supposed to be a reputable airline and I expected so much more from them.

Flight 6034 (KLM) was from Detroit Wayne, Michigan on 5/28/20 to New Delhi IGI, India. Return was from flight 878 (KLM) from Mumbai, India on 6/13/20 to Detroit Wayne, Michigan. I paid Cheapo a total of $1,086.46 for this round-trip. My flight was cancelled due to COVID19 and as soon as I found out in March 2020, I called Cheapo and KLM to inquire about the next steps and to obtain a refund. I have called Cheapo since March 2020 to obtain a refund as my flight was cancelled. After four months, I received a refund from Cheapo in late July 2020 but only for $660.51. I called KLM again, and they confirmed that I should receive a full refund as my flight was cancelled. I called Cheapo about two weeks ago and their reply was that KLM did not update my ticket’s flight status to cancelled, therefore I did not receive a full refund of $960.51 and was penalized $300. My father booked this same round-trip and we paid separately. He promptly received a full refund of $960.51 after calling Cheap only twice or so.  They are treating their customers unequally and this is very wrong. Both KLM and Cheapo have given me the runaround. I spoke to Cheapo on 8/2/20 to ask for an update.

1281,"In February 2020 I booked a Delta flight to Italy through a travel agency. The flight was supposed to be in March, but it got cancelled because of the pandemic. After repeatedly calling Delta for about a month, I finally got someone on the line in April, who tells me that there is no problem in rescheduling a flight through Delta whenever I’d know which dates I’d travel. It’s June and I finally know when I can travel to Italy. After hours on the line, I finally reach Delta, but this time they tell me that I can’t book a flight with them since I bought a ticket through a travel agency. They say that I have to contact the travel agency asking for another flight or a refund. First contradiction. I try to reach out to the travel agency, but they don’t reply, so I fill out the forms asking for another flight or a refund. Days go by, and I don’t have any answer from the travel agency, so I call Delta, I explain the situation with the travel agency, and they tell me that there’s no problem at all actually, and that I can book a flight directly with them. Second contradiction. This is already quite convoluted, but at least I booked the flight I think. However, a couple of days later I receive a refund from the travel agency, and I later found that my booking has been canceled. I call Delta, and they tell me that the reservation has been canceled because, by issuing the refund, the travel agency itself canceled my reservation. I call the travel agency and they tell me they didn’t cancel my reservation, and that they don’t even have the power to do such a thing. I then call Delta again and they admit that it wasn’t the travel agency, but Delta that canceled the reservation because I got the refund. So what they previously told me about the travel agency cancelling the reservation was false (if not even a lie), and they rebooked my flight knowing that I would have it later canceled again by them. I explain the situation, telling them that I was first being told that I could reschedule the flight with Delta, then that it wasn’t possible, then they rescheduled the flight, then they canceled it. They tell me that I can’t expect to receive a refund from the travel agency and also reschedule the flight. I said that I wouldn’t have asked for the refund in the first place if I could have rescheduled the flight directly with Delta in the first place and that I’d gladly return the refund in order to reschedule the flight, given that now the price of my flight was three times higher. They tell me that this is not possible. I finally booked another flight. with another airline. In conclusion, besides the endless waits on the phone, I received false, misleading and inconsistent information from Delta. The customer service has been truly awful. I’m shocked they treat customers this way, in particular given the current crisis in the aviation industry. If they want to scare away customers, that’s the most efficient way to do it.",Postive

1284,"Thanks Delta, for reminding me that my pockets are not deep enough for you all to care how me or my property is treated. I've been lied to, witnessed a clear violation of how things are supposed to be handled, and I've been ghosted. Some backstory: relocating as a remote worker. I packed my work equipment with multiple layers of bubble wrap and clothing, put them into a box, and sealed it with guerilla tape. I checked my box as an oversized special item to prevent any mishandling. The lady at the counter marked the box as fragile and oversized. She then told me that I could claim the item in a designated area as it would not drop down the conveyor belt. She then asked me to sign away all liability saying that they'll take REASONABLE care of my property but aren't liable for damages. Well, Delta's definition of reasonable care means that they'll stack boxes on top of a box marked fragile, send it over to standard baggage claim tumbling down the conveyor belt, bend the box(how?), Then the coup de grâce, puncture the box and it's content... So I see the box tumbling down the conveyor belt and I'm dmbfounded... This is not what was discussed. Its about to flip over the sides since it tumbled end over end but luckily It caught balance and landed with a thump back onto the belt. I go to the counter to explain to the lady who's clearly annoyed, what happened to my box. She asked me to test if everything in there works. I couldn't find the wires for the monitors and we ended up speaking to Scott Winters of LAX. I pointed out every bend and hole on the box saying, this isn't reasonable care. After seeing the box Scott said I can go home to buy wires and test the monitors within 24hrs, email him and then we'll work something out if it's broken. I'm guessing this was to just get me out of the airport because he later ghosted me. The next morning I got some new wires and plugged in my BenQ which worked fine. I then unwrap my dell 27"" ultrasharp ips monitor and see what appears to be a hole that's penetrated the first two layers of the screen. Naive and hopeful, I plug in the monitor thinking that it'll still work and if it's just a scratch then I can live with that. But after plugging it in That scratch started to look more like fractures as the screen begin to illuminate. It was done. I called Delta's help support number, when I finally got through to someone I barely got out half a sentence before being interrupted. The gentleman proceeded to interrupt me a few more times until I finally got my story out and after a final interruption I just hung up. I emailed Scott to update him on the progress I had made, I also sent a message via Facebook messenger to Delta to figure out how to actually put a claim in for the issue. Scott replied back thanking me for keeping him in the loop. I finally got a ticket submitted and within an hour someone had already denied my claim. I cc Scott on the email asking them to make things right. They offer me $250 travel coupon. I absolutely decline and you can remove it from my account then remove my account. I send another message to Scott, he was friendly so I'm sure he'd be willing to help, nope. He ghosted me. I've made quite a few trips with Delta in the past for work and I religiously chose them because of their seating space and how easy it is to check in. No more. I'd rather fly spirit. You all really showed how much you value the 9-5 regular Joe. I bet if I was a frequent first class passenger you all would have been way more hepful and and remorseful for your clear negligence of handling and someone else's property.",Negative

1287,"I posted a review in early June to describe the horrendous service I have received from this supposedly reputable company. I thought I would post an updated review as quite frankly I wouldn't want to wish my experience on anyone who is thinking of using Singapore Airlines in the near future. In light of the lockdown in many countries in March including my own (UK) which sparked a lot of flight cancellations, I decided to request a full cash refund from Singapore Airlines via my travel agent and then through them direct from the start of April. For weeks they were telling me that a cash refund could not be offered and I could only re-book or be offered credit towards booking another flight. They were in fact acting illegally at this point and after three weeks they decided to officially cancel my flight (due to take off in early May) and offer a cash refund. I have now been waiting almost three month's for a cash refund from Singapore Airlines via my travel agent. Singapore Airlines advisors are in fact being instructed to delay/lie to customers by saying that they have been in touch with travel agents to issue refunds without having actually done so. I have personally received time dated copies of my travel agent getting in contact with Singapore Airlines in early April, no communication from the airline has been received thus far. Not only are Singapore Airlines now lying (in writing I may add) but they are also breaking the law and I have had no choice other than to make contact with the financial ombudsman and report them to the Civil Aviation Authority. For anyone reading this review, I urge you to think twice before booking through Singapore Airlines as it is unlikely you may never see your refund if these outstanding circumstances occur.",Negative

There were some delays when waiting for a refund but this is expected considering the current climate. I flew with Singapore Airlines to Australia recently but unfortunately Singapore placed a banned on transit through their country so my return leg was cancelled. This is totally out of their control and they shouldn't be blamed for decisions that protect their staff and country. I look forward to flying with them in the future.",Postive
1290,I am a medical professional who lives in Indonesia for the last 15 years. I responsibly test my bloods for COVID 19 and have tested negative each time. I take precautions responsibly. People fly into Singapore from many countries yet I cannot. I have been unable to work at the hospital for 4 months. During this period I have not received a salary. I do not wish to enter Singapore city but merely transit in the demarcated areas for a few hours then join my onward flight. Why? The local Singapore airlines team were extremely rude and could not answer my questions. The city I live in has an extremely low infection rate.,Negative
1291,"I am really disappointed in SIA. My flight ref RV8EES has been delayed due to border closure since April. They rebooked me in June after they had to cancel my April flight . Border is still an issue, so I requested a credit> said no> only the agent cheaptickets.sg can do it which by the way has ignored all my emails so far. I have a connection in Spore on ANA to Tokyo, then US. Even though that ticket is also thro' another agent that is of no help, ANA has been kind enough to take ownership of my ticket and await for the revised US schedule and border opening to get me a seat without additional charge. On top of it if the border does not open , they offered to extend my ticket to Mar 2021 > 3 months over my ticket expiry date. SIA, however, states they can rebook me in Nov per my request at ADDITIONAl sgd400 on top of my paid ticket for a one way ticket KL-Spore. NOW THIS IS AFTER SIA sends out an announcement May 29th which appears to state waiver of fees/costs for rebooking due to Covid.

The ""redeem my credit"" button led me to another page where, when I entered my information, it said my credit had ""no remaining value"". This meant I was forced to call their customer service number, where I waited on hold for TWO HOURS. Eventually, I had to leave for an appointment, meaning I never got through. It's annoying that because Delta can't design a website that works, I'm the one who has to spend hours sitting on hold. Why is it okay for airlines to treat their customers this way? Every time I call they say they are experiencing a higher than normal call volume. I don't see how they can use this excuse on an ongoing basis, year after year. I'd switch to a different airline, but this sort of treatment seems to be the norm with every airline.",Postive

Agent suggested I book via agency even though I said I had a pet traveling with me, and that I should call afterwards to add pet fee. I booked the flight via agency as suggested, called one airline and added pet fee, called JetBlue again: Agent- ""I'm sorry, we cannot add pets to flights by agencies. -Yes, even though other airline allowed the pet.

NO response!!! Nobody saw or heard anything. They kept saying that cleaning crew could “take” it. I described in details what kind of an iPad, the cover, the color, the model, exactly where and how I left it to the t. Even when called it felt like I was taking to a robot, no compassion, no understanding, no interest in what I was saying and concerned about. Very poor customer service!

They are only willing to issue a voucher to be booked within 18 months. While I understand under normal circumastance this would be an acceptable form of action, but given the current climate I find it to be appalling. It took me 3 years to save up enough money to take my family on this trip and now that everything is shut down and they do not want state to state travel there is no point in taking this trip. As a person with limited means there is no garauntee I will have the ability to take another trip anytime in the next few years.

JetBlue advertises no cancelation fees, etc. due to this. That's a lie! After spending a considerable amount of time waiting to speak with a representative I was informed that is not the case - I would be receiving a credit that needed to be used within 1 year or lose it! My nephew will have a difficult time making those arrangements - Church, reception hall on top of countless other weddings cancelled and probably won't be able to do that in time. I'm a retired investment banker and have been through the bailout process before. If you look at the balance sheet/income statement of JetBlue it's clear they will be bankrupt by the end of May, (not the only airline by the way). So it's either 2 solutions - 1) JetBlue goes bankrupt, no credit. 2) Taxpayer bailout while you screw the taxpayer by lying about refunds. The fact that they would due this to a senior citizen is a direct reflection on the character of the airline. Shameless! I asked Emily, ( JetBlue representative), if she would treat her Grandfather the same way and she acknowledged she would. That's what you get with JetBlue.

I contacted Spirit airline customer service regarding this issue. The agent corrected the dates but failed to credit me my funds. Also, the agent was very rude had terrible customer service. Now I’m back on the telephone waiting for 1 hour to speak to another agent.. how unprofessional and inconvenient. I don’t recommend this airline and this will be my last time booking with them.",Negative
1361,"We booked our trip and the flight down was fine even though they nickel and dime you for anything, but the day we were leaving Orlando our flight was cancelled because the plane hasnt arrived from Denver and if it did they didnt have a crew to man the flight.  I should also mention that we waited at the airport for 6 hours before they said anything.  After finding out we werent leaving that day we were told that the next flight out was on a thurs and our original day to leave was a sunday, well this wouldnt work since we had to return to work and school.  The only thing they did was give us $45 for lunch and $100 voucher for each passenger on another flight in the future with no expiration date but they wouldnt put any of us up in a hotel we would have to find our own lodging.  Well knowing we couldn't stay another 4 days i rented a car and drove 21 straight hours back to where we parked our at the airport and then drove another 2 hours home. Fast forward to 2020 we are planning a trip in the summer and i think i have $400 in vouchers well guess what they expire 60 days after date issued but after complaining i was given another 60 day extension which was perfect.  I go to book the flight which are so cheap $45 per person each way it comes to $360 and i knew the vouchers dont apply to tax, fees etc so i was ok paying something.  Well when we go to book the rep tells me the vouchers are only good for $8.60 each and i would have to pay nearly $400 and I am being told that each flight only cost $8.60 and the rest is taxes and fees lol. I called back after i was disconnected and went through this process again and now i am being told each voucher has a value of $14 each  lol.  After being disconnected again i called back put on hold...disconnected again...called back...spoke to a supervisor and we get all the way to the end of booking i get disconnected lol but do you think they would call me back since they had my number nope!!! i call again speak to a supervisor and before get into anything i ask her to please confirm that she will call me back if we get disconnected and she said she would...we get towards the end and guess what disconnected and guess what no call back..i cant make this up.  I have to say this is not just the worst airline company but worst company i have ever dealt with.",Negative
1362,"Don't be under any illusions that this is a luxury airline or there's going to be anything nice about your flight. This is the bus with wings. But you know you're getting that when you book with Spirit. They're not advertising themselves to be a nice experience. They offer a low base fare. The nickel and dime you for everything, so you should be careful when you book. Their luggage fees can be extortionate, and they'll charge you for each leg of your trip (So let's say you're flying to Medellin from NYC and you have a layover in Fort Lauderdale. For Spirit, that's 4 flights, times the $50 luggage fee, so that's $200!). You might find a nicer airline that is CHEAPER when you include the cost of luggage. But they're up front about the costs and they're pretty good at letting you know what to expect. Just be careful and look at the bottom line when comparing pricing.",Postive

1366,"I had had more than one horrible experience with Spirit Airlines. First of all, the flight itself may seem cheap but often, you will pay more for your luggage and if you’d like a drink of water on the flight, you’ll pay for that too. By the time you land, you could have flown in comfort and appreciation on any other airline for much cheaper. Don’t waste your time paying for the insurance because they only want to give you credit, not cash back. I had to cancel my flight because it was to Miami, when they had declared a state of emergency anticipating a hurricane. Spirit told me because the flight itself wasn’t canceled, I had 60 days to rebook. Apparently, money expires. I called within the 60 days and explained that I had not had time to plan my next trip yet and needed more time. They agreed to extend the credit. Finally ready to rebook my flight and every time I tried, I was told my credit is expired. I have planned 4 vacations since then (2 on Spirit, both of which I had to pay for even though I have credit) one taken, the other canceled due to COVID-19 and now they only want to give me 80% of my refund. Currently Spirit owes me over $500 and they have lost a well traveled customer for life!",Negative

1381,"I have been a loyal customer of ctrip website for many years. I think the website has done a great job to transform and digitalise the travelling industry in China and worldwide. the customer service was always helpful. However my recent experience has been more than disappointing amid the Covid-19. My flight from London to Beijing in February was cancelled by Air China. I tried to contact the customer service of ctrip to rebook. The agent was never available. I paid RMB4000 to rebook the flights for March hoping these fees would be reimbursed as it was the airline who cancelled the flight. After many frustrating attempt to contact Air China and Ctrip, I only found out Air China always allows for one free reschedule if the flight was cancelled by the airline. It was Ctrip's mistake to make customers to pay for the reschedule fee in the first place. Although finally getting the Ctrip agent to admit it is possible to get the fees back, they repeatedly tell me to wait. So did I - from March to May, from May to August. But still waiting. The expected resolved time goes from 1 month, to three months, now to six months which I found utterly frustrating.  Given these reschedule fees should never be charged in the first place as it is a cancelled flight, I hope ctrip can refund me these fees asap and take it up with Air China separately, as an end customer, I should NOT be caught in-between the sales agent(ctrip) and the service provider(Air China).

I elected a credit simply to give me more time to assess and deal with other travel related matters due to COVID-19. The agent, Alexis, did not disclose I would give up the right to a cash refund during a conversation when we were exploring options of cancelling my flight due to COVID-19. Had I known, I would have taken the refund. They also did not disclose that my credit was limited to flying ANA or Star Alliance. I would have never limited myself to that. I've tried to appeal but to no avail even though the manger admits the miscommunication and confusion. They rest of the signed agreement even though they admit fault in less than transparent communication. The manger accused me of neglect by not asking about the cash refund option. Absurd.

They changed my flight to my home country half an hour before leaving, after paying $150 of taxy to get to the airport and they told without any reason me that the flight was simply cancelled and I had to go home to wait for the next available flight. After hours of arguing with them they decided to give me a flight with another airline and they told me that I didn't have to pay anything. Without considering the fact that the flight was leaving in less than an hour and I needed to do another time che check in for the luggage and all this in another part of the airport that can only be reach by train. I had no word to describe my frustrations. I run to the train and get to the other terminal. I reached the check in and the employees of the other airline tell me that I had to pay $40 plus for the luggage. I said that is not possible, the other guys told me that it was included. Nothing to do, if I wanted to get my luggage on the plane I had to pay. They told me that for any complain I had to go to the other terminal.

1387,"Me and my friend were supposed to fly back home to NYC on 2/23, but they kicked us out of the plane and rescheduled our flight for 2/25 because my friend “looked sick and needed to talk to a doctor”. The doctor asked if we went to China in the last 2 weeks, the answer was no. However they did not allow us back on the plane, and my checked bag flew to Newark. I went to the luggage office to ask them to send my bag back, and no one was there even though it was during their operating hours. I called the number provided at the door, no one picked up. Later that day, a passenger from the same flight called me to tell me that he has my case and gave me the address of his hotel in NYC to come and pick it up. Not only that I lost two days at work, but also I had those additional expanses for staying two more days in Houston, and I was without my bag because it was picked up by another passenger UNNOTICED! We called them several times and filed several complaints- the response was - “we’ll call you back” or the ticket was passed on to another department. They were sorry that we had to reschedule our flight and they were happy that I was able to reunite with my bag. After one month of conversing back and fourth, they offered two $100 vouchers, refunded $85 for my checked bag and $12 for my toiletries that I bought in Houston. They did not cover any other expenses, including our accommodation, and transportation from/to the airport and to the hotel where my bag was situated. We went through embarrassment on the plane, stress about my lost bag, additional expanses and suffering due to rescheduled flight, but the compensation we got was ridiculous. We also spent so much time negotiating for that little compensation they gave us. I will never ever choose Spirit Airlines. I don’t need their vouchers!",Negative

1395,"Recently, in my dealings with Trip.com I have experienced terrible treatment.  It has cost me much time and money.  After talking with the company for days, they have not agreed to take any responsibility or refund me any significant sum of money compared with the amount that I have lost. First of all a couple notes.  This is my first time writing such a complaint.  However, given the amount of grief, time, and money the whole experience has cost me.  I felt the need to write this complaint about Trip.com and CTrip. At the very least so those who may be thinking about using Trip.com for their travel may consider a different option.  Or, hopefully, to help in making trip.com more accountable to their clients. I will accept that this incident occurred during strange times.  A lot of travel bans were going up because of the Covid 19 virus, and there was a lot of chaos. However, given my experience with the other similar companies, I still put the blame squarely on CTrip. I was trying to buy my ticket to Shanghai from Vancouver. I bought the first ticket with Flight  Network.  It was to transfer through Taiwan.  Unfortunately, Taiwan announced a Travel Ban.  I was contacted by Flight Network shortly after.  They informed me my full ticket would be refunded. Following this, I purchased another ticket with Expedia.  This flight was to transfer through Hong Kong.  Unfortunately, a couple days later Hong Kong announced the same travel ban.  Same situation, I was contacted by Expedia and was told I would get a full refund. Then, I purchased a ticket through CTrip.  This flight was to transfer through Japan.   Flight was cancelled. Not only was I not given a refund for this ticket, but they didn’t even inform me that the flight wouldn’t be able to arrive in Shanghai. The flight landed in Tokyo.  After it landed I was informed that the connecting flight would not take off and there was no way for me to reach Shanghai.  I was told I would just need to buy a ticket directly back to Canada at my personal expense. I believe that CTrip should give me a full refund for my flight and a return ticket.  At the very minimum they should reimburse me for the flight I already made.  Instead what I got was completely brushed off by the company. “Sorry, there is nothing we can do.”  All they offered was about 40$ for the flight tax from Tokyo to Shanghai.   I was so insulted by this, I did not even accept this money, and have instead opted to write this letter. As soon as money has changed hands they no longer care about you. I will never use this company again.  Even if I have to pay slightly more somewhere else. UPDATE:  It's been 6 days since I received a response on here.  They asked for my information, I gave it to them, and radio silence ever since.",Negative
1396,"UPDATE：Five days after I posted this review, the same awful guy called to inform me that they get lost with their vendor ""Brazil Ftour"" for a month, they are not aware what's going on and I still have to wait, after having been waiting for two months already?! That's what they mean by ""you'll be contacted for an update"". Ctrip/Trip.com, do you expect me to contact your vendor directly? Or do you expect me to be responsible for your chaotic internal supervision problems?!  Extremely Ridiculous!!! This company has long been surrounded with negative news in mainland China. If it hadn’t been for buying a last-minute ticket, I would never have considered use it. And now my experience just double confirms that it’s truly a fraud. Here is my story: I purchased a one way ticket from Ctrip on 24th March, but my flight got cancelled the same day. I submitted the refund request on 26th March. Their official website states 100% clearly that I was supposed to get my money (more than £1200) back no later than 15th April. That’s a large amount to me so I also called to double check. They asked me to await patiently and even said that even though the airlines failed to return the money by then, they would also like to prepaid me to keep their promise. So I’ve been waiting patiently. However, as you expect, until now, 30 days past the day they promised, I still haven’t received anything. The whole nightmare begins after I began to approach them on 16th April. It turns out that my case is in the charge of a guy with the last name Dai (853016). If I will give Ctrip 0 stars for their company behaviours, dealing with this guy makes me want to amend it to Negative 5. I sent millions of messages through their APP to ask him to call me back to update, got stood up millions of times. The very few time when I was extremely lucky enough to get a call back, he behaved utter condescending, kept asking me to wait without any reasonable excuse, claimed that the airlines has not processed my case yet while refused to offer any evidence. After also checked with English customer service team, it shows that the airline processing has already been completed on 1 April!! This guy even doesn’t bother himself to have a look at their systems, simply use his imagination to deal with the case, needless to say contacting the airlines to follow up. All my complaint about him is transferred to himself again and I am not able to substitute for another guy. It’s always him while he refuses to contact. With regard to why the airline processing completed on 1 April while the money hasn’t been returned yet, the latest response I got from English customer service team is ""Even though the airlines has processed the money, it has only been processed and not refunded yet.”, which confuses me very much…. TBH, based on my experience with agency, vendors and airlines, I don’t really think the money of an order being cancelled within 48 hours has already reached the airlines.  Withholding the money from customers for capital turnover doesn’t sound appropriate. Anyway, let’s see how this story will end.",Negative

The rules changed daily regarding my options, and there were multiple emails between BCC and myself trying to better understand the situation.  I tried to find other trips to utilize the ""full fare"" but the options they provided were much lower in value than the original flight.  The final option that was presented to me was for a partial credit to be used on a future flight, still before the anniversary date of the original purchase.  So rather than applying $7,188 (original value), now, I was told that I would only have $4,272 to be applied on a trip that most likely will not be able to happen as who would want to travel internationally before Jan 2021?!

However, calling ctrip closer to the date (27th of April) as we were concerned that our itinerary have not changed on the APP to the 8th May yet. They reassured us that our flight is still on the 8th as planned however, they also told us to call the night before the flight to make sure it’s still on. Within less then 24hours, on the night at 6pm of Tuesday, 28th of April we got contacted by Ctrip to say that there is no flights on the 8th of May again, however they have rescheduled our flight to the 29th of April based on my previous conversation with them saying that I want get my parents home as soon as possible. I told them strongly that it is impossible for us to fly the next day with less than 24 hours notice as my parents do not speak a word of English and they unable to get to the airport on the morning of 29th of April. I was told by them that they will call me back soon and they said they understand and will continue to negotiate with China Eastern to get my parents home. Ctrip called on the afternoon of 29th of April and told us that we have missed the flight on the 29th of April which they rescheduled (without our consent). In addition to rescheduling without our consent, they did not even email an itinerary to us. They told us that we can get on a flight on a later day, but we need to pay the processing fee, AS WELL as the remaining difference in ticket price, which we refused to pay as we did not request to reschedule ANY of the flights ourselves. It was all done by Ctrip without us consenting. We should not be pay for a mistake that is clearly done by Ctrip, we should not be punished for Ctrip’s disrespectful and irresponsibility. We believed that we have been unfairly treated and scammed by Ctrip as our original price of flight was much lower than what it is now. For whatever they have done to my parents is very unethical and should be investigated further by the government.",Negative

Close your company if you don´t like the contact with foreigners. Anyway you are not able to survive without the money of foreigners. Pegasus (like many other companies in Turkey) seem to forget that. It is bad enough that the staff at the check-in counter is uneducated and unfriendly. But on top they are uninformed and unprofessional. I asked the woman during check-in if the BolBol-points for the flight will be counted automatically during check-in. She didn´t even know about the mile-collecting system for members!!!!! It is like staff of Lufthansa wouldn´t know their own miles&more program. And when I asked that stupid woman which didn´t even understand English very well, if there is a colleague that understands English, she started to burst in laughter with the brainless collague sitting next to her, which was very busy checkin gher finger nails, while passengers were waiting to check-in. This is what happens when most jobs in a country are given to friends and family and not to qualified people. And it seems that the IT-department of Pegasus is not more professional neither. They advertise on the website that it is much easier now to contact the company by mail. But when you click the button ""contact us"" the same information opens again an again, but no contact form. So embarrassing. But the cherry on the cake is that on board of Pegasus flights they start they push the temperature up to sometimes 30 degree! It always happens before they sell the drinks. Guess why.... As usual people complain among each other but are not brave enough to speak to the responsibles. During the last flight I asked the crew if they always higher the temperature so extremely shortly after the start to sell more drinks and if they could please turn it down to a normal level. They immedeately did so, because they knew I discovered the reason for that heating procedure. I fly 1-2 times a month. But this I have never experienced with any other company.

When the plane landed in Egypt, we continued to receive boarding passes from Egypt to Toronto.  Then we were directed to the hotel for transit passengers at the airport.  We were told that the room would be provided by the hotel staff within 1 or 2 hours.  After six hours, they didn't provide us with a place to rest.  When we turned to them to ask why they didn't provide us with a place, we were told that the Canadian Embassy did not allow us to continue our trip to Canada.  We were not allowed to fly from Egypt to Toronto.  However, we have provided round-trip tickets, Canadian visa and passport, invitation letter from school, invoice, accommodation.  When we asked them to give us any documents stating that the Canadian Embassy did not want us to go to Canada, they said that they could not share any information or documents about it.  After we had the following flight to Erbil for 33 hours, I asked them to provide a room.  But they didn't give us any room and asked us to sit on the chairs and we had to sit on the chairs for 16 hours.  They insulted us and treated us like we did a crime.  The next day we returned to Erbil with a 23:00 flight and immediately went to the EgyptAir office in Erbil.  Upon our request, they could not give any document showing our situation.  In the meantime, we learned that they gave a document to a family like us with a similar problem.  EgyptAir led us to VFS Global, a visa office.  We went to VFS 2 times globally and each time it told us that there isn't any disqualification to go to Canada.  We sent a mail to the Canadian Embassy, ​​they said that you did not see any harm in your flight from Canada.  By the way our luggages claim, they didn't give them back but two days.  We didn't have any clothes.  Claiming our luggages, one of them was broken.  We had to find a place to stay during this time because we used to live in Sulaymaniyah, not Erbil, and we had to buy new clothes.  a day or two later we bought a $ 4700 ticket again and we flew CANADA in transit through Europe on the way or did not experience a problem in CANADA.

The issue arrives when you reach the airport in Egypt and you are met with the airport staff. The other times i arrived and had a layover over of 12 hours or more the airline has always accommodated me with a hotel room. When I came this time in January 2020 I had a layover of 14 hours I followed the signs and reached the information desk and asked If i would be getting a room like every other time. I'm not sure what is going on in egypt but because I could not speak their language they were very rude. I was told they are not responsible for providing me anything and if I wanted to sleep I could sleep in the prayer room or on a bench somewhere. I get it hotels are not cheap so If I could not get a free one I'd just pay for one. I asked if I could go pay for one, the person behind the desk said go back down stairs and talk to someone there. I tried to go down stairs the security guard grabbed me and started yelling at me in a language I did not understand. I tried to explain to him that I have a flight in 14 hours so I'm trying to get a hotel room. He took me to a sign that had English writing in it saying ""passengers departing cant go this way."" Again i tried to explain to him that the people behind the desk told me to go this way. He started banging the sign and pointing to it like I didnt get it. Not trying to get into an issue with him i went back to the desk which was about 15 feet from those stairs. I asked the person behind the desk if they could please explain to this gaurd to let me through. I get to the desk now this person has changed i tried to explain to him my situation and this guy told me I dont pay his wages and he cant walk around and hold my hand telling everyone to make my life easier. He also said you westerners always want things handed to you. I have never seen such a disrespectful airport in my life. f I figured I'd just walk around to kill time I used the washroom and the cleaner handed me a paper towel as im leaving the washroom he was screaming at me ""foolos"" or something like that, I soon find out that it means money. He wanted money for handing me a towel lol. I use to recommend Egypt air but after that experience Id never travel with them again I'll pay 1000$ extra for a ticket but not use them and for sure i will never travel through Egypt.

For a big organisation like them it is shameful that they are getting it so wrong and coming across as fraudulent. I was called up and given price changes for 3 dates ranging from £40 to £150. When the payment link was first sent to me it was for £420 for 2 pax. I enquired about more dates and then was told that it would cost £800 per passenger to make a date change. This is even more expensive than booking a new return and letting the existing go to waste! I was told that they need to contact the airline to make a date change but when I spoke to the airline, the help desk there said normally agents don't come to them - my ticket had a firewall on it and they could not access it. If  they want to make money out of a change why don't they just be transparent about it rather than say that they are charging an admin fee of £11 and anything else will be a fare change.

Consequently the score of 5 for our flights have to be reduced to 3 for non-responsiveness to the baggage claim.

I never wanted credit vouchers or cash from Jetstar, I just wanted to claim insurance on my non-cancellable flight but they couldn't even get that right after 3 or 4 chats. I was eventually issued credit vouchers (which expire in 6 (now 12) months). Honestly, in these times - nobody would utilise these vouchers / dare make plans to do so. Travel may also become very expensive and we would probably end up having to top up much more just to utilise these vouchers and fly with Jetstar.

The T&Cs on the voucher are also incredibly restrictive - the voucher must be used in one go and any outstanding balance will be lost (my voucher is for 4 people all on holiday together so effectively this money is lost).

The world is experiencing very hard times, we all know that. Australia is an island and needs to keep the airlines healthy. Makes sense. BUT THE MONEY FROM THEIR CUSTOMERS IS NOT THE CAPITAL THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO USE TO DO SO. My friend and I were travelling to Vietnam. We were trying to be cautious and followed Smart Traveller (official governement information published in regards the safety of the traveller) which clearly indicated not to travel and decided not to risk our health and request a voucher AS A REFUND WAS NEVER GONNA BE THEIR PLAN. But the problem is that we can't use our vouchers in the future as I AM NOT LONGER THERE and my friend will be leaving very soon. We prooved that I was leaving the country as an initial plan in late April, therefore I WAS NEVER GONNA BE THERE AFTER OUR TRIP TO VIETNAM. So, a voucher doesn't make sense. And we don't want a voucher. We NEED our money back. We have explained them several times. We have no money. We are unemployed. We are not receiving financial support from any government. And we are only asking for what is ours. It is A REAL SHAME how they have treated us (my friend, really) on the phone, trying to make us look like fools, trying to make us finish their endless calls with hours put on hold, telling us they would call us back and didn't do it.

This service which was unacceptable and totally rude was provided, the last call, by WEN and the phone call code is 14336136. We are asking FOR HELP. We need our money back and this people are only laughing at our faces willing for us to give up. Well, we'll keep trying.

1510,"Worst airline I've ever flown with to date. Here are some of the issues we faced during a trip from London Heathrow to Tokyo's Narita airport, with a stop over in Moscow. -When we arrived in Tokyo and were waiting at the carousel for our luggage we noticed a box with a list of names on going around - which included both mine and my partners names. After visiting the Aeroflot desk we were informed that our bags were still in Moscow and that we would have to wait til tomorrow to receive them. When I asked why they hadn't made it to Tokyo I was told, we didn't have time to put your bags on the flight... Wow. Although, I will add that at least they had the decency to deliver the bag to our hotel the following evening - it could have been worse!  However, we had to buy things to sustain ourselves til then which was highly irritating. -We ordered asian vegetarian meals for all our flights but only received that meal once out of the 6 meals we were offered, and 3 of the meals were the exact same too. A bit of variety would have been nice! Another thing I found irritating was that we were given boring items when it wasn't needed. For instance, everyone eating meat received a milky way with their meal while we got an orange.. this happened for pretty much every dessert. Meat eaters got cake and we got fruit. Being vegetarian doesn't meal I want to eat healthy - give me the chocolate and cake PLEASE. Very disappointing.. -On our final flight for our meal (dinner) we were told by the air crew that there wasn't a vegetarian meal booked for us. I had called to organise it after booking the flight and then again the day before our flight to confirm, and we had received veggie meals on the 3 other flights so that was a bit confusing. But we said no worries and went to sleep instead. I was awoken after everyone had eaten by a member of the air crew who told us there was in fact vegetarian meals for us and would we like them. At that point I was just upset about being woken up after accepting the fact that they had nothing for us.. but I regretfully said yes as the meal was so salty I couldn't actually eat it! -During our return flight from Tokyo to Moscow an announcement stated that cigarette smoke had been detected in one of the bathrooms, followed by a threatening message to those doing so. This understandably panicked us however we saw no real reaction from the air crew, they just seemed to carry on as usual and nothing further was mentioned. Later on in the flight the same announcement happened again that someone had a cigarette in the toilets, which again was met with no reaction. As we departed the plane I saw no security, no arrest of the person doing so - nothing. Why bother telling us and worrying us about it if you are just going to allow the person to get away with it? Why are you seemingly okay with people smoking on an airplane?! If there is no reaction you are basically telling people that it doesn't matter if they smoke on the aircraft which is unbelievable. -The shorter flight had more leg room than the long haul, which gave me horrific back pains for the first few days of our trip which was just a terrible start to the trip. -On the longer flight my TV didn't work properly. When I plugged in my charger the video would, and it was losing charge by being plugged in. And with some films, the screen would constantly glitch. -Passing through Moscow was a complete shambles, there was no queuing system so it was really a matter of having to tell people who were pushing in front of you to get behind you because no one in the airport cared what was going on.  Honestly the worst airport I've had the displeasure of experiencing. We also had to pass through security in Moscow too, where we witnessed staff throwing trays on the ground for us to put our things in, it was so disrespectful and shocking behaviour - I've never seen this in my life. -Another annoying thing about this airline is the online check-in system. When I checked in for my return flights, I was only provided with a boarding pass for the first flight and not the second and I was aware that you need a printed copy of the boarding pass when passing through Russia so this panicked me. I contacted Aeroflot who told me that I would be provided with the boarding pass 24hrs before the time it would leave.. why?! It's a connecting flight so surely you should provide both the boarding passes at once to avoid confusion and panic. I ended up having to find a printer twice as I didn't realise until I went to print it that the pdf didn't actually contain both of the passes. Very annoying. Just wanted to add to the collection of horror stories as I really hope someone reads it and thinks twice about booking with them for their own sake. I just wish I'd looked into the reviews properly before booking my flights with them as it was a huge mistake doing so and I fully regret it. I now know why the flights were cheap, but saving a bit of money wasn't worth it in the slightest for the horrific we had with them - never again!",Negative

The plane was right there in front of us, with the last boarded passengers still walking towards the plane, but ""there was nothing that she could do, because boarding had closed"". Some other people came running 2 minutes later than us, since their connecting flight had been delayed, and they were not allowed on the plane either.

Sent: Friday, June 12, 2020, 08:55:53 PM CDT Today is Friday June 12, 2020, as of now we have not received any form of payment; not even the promised check. On March 13, 2020 Elvis Arron admitted he got full reimbursement from the airline and requested credit card information ( last four digits, expiration date ). Ever since he began to ignore phone calls and emails; it was then that I wrote my first report on Trustpilot. Next day he responded with an apologetic message that our reimbursement had been processed two days ago and asking to remove the posting. The word check was used as a form of reimbursement. Why do you send a check when is easier to recredit. Personal tantrum ?. By then over a month went by. In the meantime; we got in contact with several agents; reason why your are copied in this message; without any resolution ( because Elvis Arron was the agent single out as the one in charge? ). So all this time is a personal retaliation for the derogatory comments as a result of his unprofessionalism. This message will be copied and paste in Trustpilot, GTT, B.B.B. Trip advisor, Reddit, etc. You think going back to normal business will be smooth? Three months in this horrible ordeal? THREE MONTHS!

Trip Advisor May 22, 2020, 2:30 PM Save Very sad that we use their services to purchase two tickets to Italy in March. Due to the Pandemia and the country lockdown; we had to cancel our trip. We purchased the tickets on November 28th, 2019. Trips were cancelled, and airlines were reimbursing full fare with the exception if you bought it thru and travel agency. Ovago's representative (Elvis Arron) has been deliberately withholding reimbursement even after stating that Ovago got the reimbursement from the airline. As of today: 5-22-2020 we haven't receive any payment. Furthermore, Elvis Arron said that he was going to send a check. So from using a credit card for purchase instead of recrediting, now they are saying: check. Nobody responds to our claim because we've been blocked.

1514,The only reason there is one star is because I couldn't write a review unless I rated this Terrible company. The rudeness of the people I have ever dealt with!!!! Trying to get my money back from a ticket I  purchased and they have no record of it. I was on the phone for two and a half days and still nothing. I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone !!!

1516,"The worst and rudest customer service ever. I called them several times in two weeks to cancel my ticket. The first time they told me the ticket should cancel through the airline, after contacting the airline, they told me I bought a ticket from this agency and this branch of GTT is responsible for canceling my ticket. Each time I called them, they gave me a new phone number as a number that is responsible for canceling my ticket (during two weeks they gave me more than 15 phone numbers and the interesting thing is that none of them were repeated and answered). When I asked for the reason they shouted at me 🤐 The funniest part is that I called the GTT office in the Seattle and they help me to cancel my ticket less than 15 minutes.",Negative

1528,"When we booked our trip we paid extra not to have a long wait for our connecting flight in Houston. We were supposed to depart from Mexico at 6am. We arrived at the airport around 3 am to find out our flight was delayed till 10am. There was zero communication from United to let us know our flight was delayed by hours. We waited in Mexico for 7 hours and we missed our connection in Houston and had to wait another 6 hours. This has been a horrible traveling experience and a complete waste of time. The reason our flight was moved is because there was no flight crew. That is completely at fault of United and their lack of communication to their customers.  I filed my initial complaint with United on August 31st 2019 and when I heard back from them they were only willing to give out vouchers at that point I asked for someone in charge and the employee stopped responding to my emails. I called United to express my terrible experience and they told me to file a refund request, which I did and they denied that and sent me back to the complaints saying ""they handle those cases better"". I called again after the email refund rejection and during that call they told me that they do not have an actual phone number or anyone for me to speak to and I would have to leave a voice mail. Today on September 18th 2019 I received an email saying they will give me a travel certificate. Not only do they have terrible communication when you travel with them, but when you try to fill out a complaint for a refund for them completely wasting your time they just keep giving you the run around from department to department and no on is willing to listen to what you want and how a travel voucher is pointless, when I spent real money on this flight and I expect to receive a REAL refund not some voucher that will go unused. This is a warning for those who are thinking about flying United just save yourself the time an go with ANY other airline. There customer service is terrible and at this point I think they just give customers the run around till the customer gives up and just accepts their worthless voucher.",Negative
1529,"We checked-in at EWR for a vacation to Russia. When we went to the gate, the flight was cancelled. Pilots standing there had no idea what was happening. Then they announced there is another flight going to Geneva at the same time from a different gate. We ran there. Agent said we need a new boarding pass  from customer service. We ran there. There was a large crowd. We stood in line for a kiosk. We got a boarding pass without a seat number which should be assigned by agent at the gate. Again a long line. Flight departure was delayed one hour at a time. We managed to get an assigned seat. We knew we will miss the connection. Went to service desk again. After a long weight got to the counter. The agent said they are holding seats in EasyJet in Geneva. She gave a printed seat information. Finally, flight left at 11:30 PM (5+ hrs delay). When we went to Geneva there was no United agent. We were desperate for some help. We were directed to Swiss Air. Agent there said, we booked through United and should call United to get re-booking. United put us on hold for a long time. We were listening to the United music. Swiss air agent took pity on us  and helped to get re-routing to Moscow. We arrived Moscow 12 hrs late. But one of the luggages did not arrive. It took another 2 hrs for the complaining process. We barely managed to get to the cruise ship. On return, we arrived airport early. There was reservation but no ticket. We were sent to Lufthansa service desk. Again, we were given United phone number. This time hold time was more than 60 minutes. We almost missed the flight. Lufthansa took pity on us and called several people and finally issued boarding passes. But there was no boarding pass for connection flight. We went through hell again. United Airlines is skilled in causing problems for passengers. When you need help, do not depend on United Service Desk. When you are abroad, United partners - Star Alliance, do not have sufficient information or authority to help the stranded customers. I RECOMMEND NOT TO USE UNITED WHENEVER POSSIBLE.",Negative
1530,Our flight was cancelled after sitting 8 hours at Newark Airport due to plane issues.  United could not get us out on another flight for 2 days.  We had to drive 8 hours home that night because we had to be home.  The issue is they would not reimburse us for our car rental to get home.  They offered us vouchers.  Why would we spend more money with someone who does not take care of their customers.  Our request was for an expense far cheaper than staying in Newark for 2 days.  Never again with United.  First and last experience,Negative
1531,Well we arrived at our gate on May 2019 Saturday 29th  T13 from Atlanta Georgia Airport Jaxville to Newark International Airport  and our flight departure was 6:15pm and our flight said canceled so we talked to the dest assistant person and she tried to find another flight for us but she couldn't and many hairs pass and still no flight so she told us that she could only get a flight until May 2019 Tuesday 31th so we told her could Tuesday work and she said yes and we got our flight for Tuesday 6:15 pmbut there was no refund for the flight that was canceled and that should be changed because we live in Garfield NJ and we had to rent another car so it was unfair the amount of money we had to pay so we went on to go get our luggage which was not refunded  again and found out some of our personal belongings were stolen from our suitcase and that is not right. You guys just threw our luggage on the floor like couldn't u think that it could be stolen.I would like that u guys wpyld be more organized better and think about your situation of not paying for the luggage we had to pay even though we didn't even go on the plane and also since we didn't know were to go we had to drive 5:30 ours to Hihara Georgia so we could stay somewhere.,Negative
1532,"If there were 10 stars I would give it to United.  They got my son on a plane so he was not stuck in the airport over night.  He flew in from Managua on American Airlines and because they had cancelled so many flights he was stuck in DFW.  He had a ticket the next morning on United Airlines.   He went over to the United Club lounge to wait until they closed and then he was going to go sleep at the gate and wait for his 5:00 am flight.  The agents were not comfortable with him doing this.  So Denise and Michelle sprung into action calling the manager Vincent and he put Sebastian on the plane.  They went so far as to give another passenger a voucher for the next flight so my son could get home safely.  This was the most amazing customer service we have experienced... ever.  We are so gracious and will always fly United.  I own a pizzeria and can't wait to tell my customers about our experience with this airline.  Unprecedented customer care and service by far!!!!

1533,"I had a business class ticket booked from Majuro - Honolulu - Los Angeles- Newark on January 9 (Airline Booking Ref: MFZ7VW).  Upon arriving in Honolulu at 3am, I was informed via text that my LA flight was delayed from 7am until 3pm that day. There were no United staff in the airport to assist me, and I was left on my own to find and fund a hotel because of United’s delay. I was then informed (via the United app) that the 3pm LA flight I was already checked into was no longer available for me. I had been bumped because the LA flight would not arrive in time for my Newark connection. I was put on a later flight still, in economy, back to New York. I called the Customer Care line and spoke with a very curt and unhelpful woman. I called again and got someone more reasonable, but she was still unable to assist me. United gave me a ‘it’s this or nothing’ ultimatum, and I was given a  middle seat in the middle aisle in economy on a 9.5 hour flight (even though I paid for a business ticket). I received no assistance, no compensation, no refund for the business to economy price difference, and no apology from United. I have called and written to United and got nothing from them. I do not understand how they can get away with bumping full fare paying business passengers to economy with delays and hotel expenses, and not even apologise for the inconvenience!",Negative

1541,"Arrogance of Aeroflot I bought the ticket ljubljana- moskow- yakutsk at the agency in accordance with the conditions of buying plane tickets. When doing the check-in in Ljubljana, I was told that the luggage will not be checked in until my final destination, Yakutsk. I asked 3 questions: -	The check-in does not cover my entire trip, until my final destination? NO -	Why not? BECAUSE THE FLIGHT MOSCOW–YAKUTSK IS CONSIDERED AN INTERNAL FLIGHT AND IT IS NOT ALLOWED TO CHECK IN LUGGAGE FROM LJUBLJANA -	Do I have enough time to transfer? OF COURSE, YOU HAVE ENOUGH TIME. So in Moscow i were too late, i didn't have enougt time, real time, to catch the plane. Several times, employees on airport told me that I was too slow, that I missed the plane through my own fault, that there was enough time to transfer. Theoretically, this may well be the case, but in practice this is definitely not possible. The owner of the my travel agency that acted as an intermediary in my buying the plane tickets, intervened in this situation and required explanations form the branch of Aeroflot. The answers they gave her were different, unclear and not precise, which point to a mistake or a fault in the system. I also sent them an complain and they answered. . The answer is utterly inadequate, insensitive and humiliating. They say that I had enough time to change the airplane .. is not true! I ordered everything to catch on the plane. And instead of helping me, they discused and asked me why I missed it. There were also no clear instructions regarding the checking of the luggage. They say that the instructions are written on their website. Then why do they have airport staff? They must first read these instructions and forward them correctly to customers. I think that I am entitled to a refund for the Moscow-Yakutsk flight ticket, which I did not use. It would also be in order to get the refunded amount for the purchase of new cards in full.",Negative
1542,"I flew from IAD to TLV via SVO on April 15th, arriving on April 16th. 2 out of the 4 bags I checked didn't make it (along with many other bags from other passengers that were all making claims at the same time that I was. It took 8 days to finally get my bags (my trip was only 12 days long..). During those 8 days I sent emails, faxes and called the airline and lost baggage service (Q.A.S) multiple times and never received any responses. The only reply I got from them was due to a Facebook message I sent, which explained I need to contact the airline directly, not through their FB page. On April 24th I decided to go to the airport and look for my bags myself. They claimed my bags were not there, but I begged to check on my own and was finally allowed. Well, they were sitting right there in their storage room! It seems that when the bags finally made it on a flight, they had NEW tags put on- meaning the airline would have NEVER found my bags, since they were searching for my old tag number. When no one claimed the bags, instead of searching their system to look for my claim, they issued a new claim to the case even though my NAME was on the baggage tag! Now, I flew back the same route arriving 4 DAYS AGO (TLV, SVO, IAD) and 3 of my 5 bags checked are missing! They claim it was due to a short stopover, but I had a 14 hour stopover!

1545,On a trip from Thailand to Copenhagen via Moscow the flight from Thailand was delayed 2½ hours and our connecting flight did not wait (it was a matter of just 40 minutes and it was an evening flight so it is hard to believe that the reason is another than simply bad planning). They claimed that the next morning flight was fully booked so we had to wait 24 hours - furthermore the flight to Copenhagen next day was delayed 2 hours due to technical problems. So a 15 hour journey turned into a 41 hour journey. And we only got a hotel room because we are a family with kids. Economical compensation? Forget about it. EU rules do not apply to non-EU airlines departing from a non-EU country. Aeroflot boasts being a modern airline when it suits them but the service level when it comes to flight transfer is genuinely Russian and somehow the Russian winter weather seems to surprise them every year. So think twice before you choose Aeroflot to save some money. They may be ok if you only go to Moscow on a direct flight but they are uncapable of handling flight transfers in a professional way.,Postive

Even when presented to their own website content they resist. And they are rude. I experienced this twice over the last two weeks. It is so dissapointing, and damaging the Star Alliance brand.

However, in this fast changing world it is vital for us to identify the names and locasions of the places accurately. One thing I am not satisfied with TripAdvisor is the fact that in few cases I ended up with different names, addresses and owners from those mentioned in your reviews (perhaps it went bankrupt or sold to someone else etc).

Best part of it was we got it for very little miles and almost no taxes and our flight itinerary was just what we wanted.  And we booked our recent trip again with Sam to Kilimanjaro Africa, and was again surprised by one of our best flights yet.  Sam gave us the best service possible from staying up nights finding the best flights for us to picking up the phone on a weekend night when we were In Africa when I wanted to double cHeck our flight.

Aggressive, confrontational, lazy, and more than rude.

Never seen anything as farcical in all my traveling days.",Negative

They downgraded our flight and we were bumped to another flight 5 hours later. No apolog, not a care in the world. Guernsey is such a beautiful island and such a nice place to visit  unfortunately it is greatly let down by the terrible airline. They dont inform any of their passengers about any delays then once you have paid for the earlier more expensive flight, they then jump you to the cheapest flights they have. So you end up losing out on about £40-£50 and a day of your holiday. Try speaking to their customer service, but they are appalling. Tell you to claim on travel insurance and that's it. Their attitude is ""you're there now. So what's your problem?"" Terrible airline.",Negative

Booked the most expensive type of ticket, and yesterday, like many others on this review board, the checkin staff tried to prevent me taking my bag as hand luggage because it was too large for the cabin - despite having travelling dozens of times with them before with the same bag.  The checkin staff were extremely rude.  The bag did fit in their non-industry-standard size ""try out"" container anyway but that didnt prevent them trying to get another 40 out of me when I had already paid nearly 500 for the return (30 min flight!!!).  That's probably why, after being around for 40 years, they have only managed to get to the size of 3-4 planes; if they improved their customer service they would have grown much more by now.  Pathetic trying to milk the captive audience on the island like that.  Good luck Flybe hope you prosper on the routes.",Negative

Sadly on my last trip, the gate staff were incredibly rude and unhelpful, refusing me access to the flight even though I arrived at the gate 15 minutes before the aircraft was meant to leave, after a delay being caused by increased security checks at Stansted Airport. The primary reason for my trip was to visit my unwell elderly mother and was highly incensed that Aurigny would do nothing to assist. I was forced to pay £322.48 to fly with another airline from another airport the same day.

1670,"BA canceled our flight a year ago and ruined our vacations in South Africa as they canceled our flight 24hr before departure (BCN-LHR leg). Reason given: bad weather. Yes, you read that well! 24 hours before, BA knew that there would be bad weather upon arriving in LHR but only for our flight (!!) as they cancelled only our flight! All other flights ran smoothly on that day and without delay! Also, the METAR/TAF, that are the professional weather reports and forecasts given to the pilots did not mention any adverse weather on that day. When we contacted BA, they changed their minds each time they responded. From operational reasons, to weather related reasons and finally to ATC restrictions. We hired AirAdvisor to get our comenpensation but the nightmare continued. Not only we had to keep on writing to AirAdvisor to know what was going on but at the end, after 6 months, we received the follwing answer: ""we look at the weather for that day and there was 100% humidity"". Yes, this was the answer! For information, 100% of humidity is produced when the formation of rain happens. They dared to tell us that they had hired a lawyer but when we asked for his name in order to continue the case on our own and pay the lawyer ourselves, they simply answered they had no the right to do it! Which right are we talking about? The final answer from AirAdvisor, super profesionnal: ""If you don't agree, please contact the airline directly!"". I let you judge this conclusion!

After 3 months of waiting, UIA ignored our claim against the law and pretended as if they had officially replied, but in fact they did not. Therefore, we involved AirAdvisor to help us with getting an answer from UIA. Even though UIA is known for being insolent and disregarding regulations, AirAdvisor staff was happy to assist us with our case. One week later after submitting a new claim, we received compensation of 1200 EUR. We appreciate their assistance and recommend AirAdvisor to everyone who has to deal with airlines claims.

We needed to get him back to Bend, Or to be near his doctors and for future care. We contacted Angel Medflight to transport him. They took over immediately and scheduled every step of the process. Their care included transportation from his bed in St John's Hospital in Jackson Hole to a bed in St Charles Hospital - Bend, Or..

1686,"I had the pleasure of working with Angel MedFlight in December of 2019. My patient was from Ohio and needed to be transported via air ambulance to an Acute In-Patient Rehab in Norwood, Ohio from Charlotte, NC. She had been denied this medical service from her insurance company, so as a Case Manager I reached out to Angel MedFlight for their assistance. Through out the whole process from requesting documents, having the Letter of Medical Necessity drafted to arranging the actual flight. The team at Angel walked Me( the Case Manger) through the entire process. They also made the day of transfer very easy as they  kept me here at the sending hospital very informed. It truly was a very seamless process from start to finish. I felt as if the Angel MedFlight was here to help the people that truly needed to be transported great distances to receive the highest level of care. And as a Case Manager it was a true pleasure to work with such an efficient team that put the patient first. This was my second time using this service, and I know if I need to transport another patient across the country I will use Angel MedFlight. Thank you for making the process as simple and efficient as possible for those that need it. Michele",Postive
1687,"I would like to give a special thanks to Angel MedFlight for an amazing experience during a stressful time. We were trying to safely transport my dad from Phoenix AZ to PA. while dealing with multiple progressive medical issues, such as vascular wounds resulting in an amputation and gastric bleeding. We found the idea of a medical flight through friends and found Angel MedFlight by simply doing a web search. From the first call to Marcey to our coordinator Carl who gave us a guaranteed price that did not vary even when Angel MedFlight had to contract a flight through a secondary med flight company due to a mechanical issue, Carl scheduled with the origin and destination facilities gathering medical records and all necessary documents for a flawless bedside to bedside transportation. When it comes the medical providers Scott Patten and Tony who meant us at bedside you automatically felt your love one is in the best hands in the business, though we had no emergency medical issues the two men exercised extreme professionalism, communication and compassion for my dad. There was NOTHING these men would not do for my dads care and comfort. When we arrived at the aircraft we were meant by the pilot Scott Pollard and co-pilot Vanessa who introduced themselves and made us feel that our experience and saftey was their upmost concern. My dad is a difficult man to deal with and everyone involved exhibited patients and compassion regardless of his rough disposition.

Flight crew was friendly as well and gave us flight details. ---  The entire family are happy with the flight, crew, and transfer. --- The only thing that might have helped was a cushion to make the bed/stretcher a bit more comfortable.

So when my husband was emergently hospitalized out of state this past November, Angel Med Flight was top of my mind. My experience with them in this capacity was as positive as all of my other interactions. The staff was easy to work with and were so helpful during a very stressful time.  The flight process from Atlanta to our home in Michigan was seamless. At the time, our insurance had denied coverage of the claim and we covered the cost ourselves.  Angel Med Flight continued working on obtaining coverage from our insurance, even after the transition was completed.  I had no expectation that our insurance company would change their mind but 4 months later we received a reimbursement check from our insurance, thanks to the persistence of Angel Med flight's staff member, Monika.

I  just want anyone and everyone who knows anyone or has anyone who may ever need this emergency medical flight service just what an exceptional experience we had and are ready to have again! Hopefully very soon!  We were very worried about the price tag, but what they do is a contract. We signed, because if they cannot get insurance to approve, we owe 0! Nothing! Our bill was not one dime! And believe me, this is literally a miracle! We have no way for my husbands transplant except to travel across country. These guys are saving Michael's life!  Our captain, Ryan, was such a rock! We had very bad weather and he made us feel safe and confident! His copilot Miguel was kind and shy, but non the less a huge part of our great experience! Michael had 2 nurses. Alyssa and David. They put Michael's health and wellbeing first in all they did. Alyssa even happened to have an iPad with several movies already downloaded for me to enjoy during flight.Now we were in Eugene, Oregon during a freezing rain storm!

From the minute we  connected by phone, Christine took over and reassured this frantic Mom in Virginia that my adult daughter injured in an accident in the wilds of Canada was in their good hands and they would make sure she would be OK.  Christine was so right!  After almost a week in rural hospitals in Canada, not getting proper care (admittedly complicated) and ""going down the tube,"" I called Angel Air to get her back home to the US and her  Doctors.  It got complicated going from one Country to another, flying in to a small airport late at night and getting a very fragile young woman to a hospital 400+ miles away through another airport that given the hour was actually closed.  Angel Air staff did their magic and my daughter survived!  She was accompanied on this journey by an incredible medical staff and crew.  I had nothing but positive interactions with Christine who was my contact arranging the trip to Monica in the Billing Office who made sense of and always followed through on the aggravating issues surrounding insurance requirements and re-imbursement.  I want to stipulate that I do not own nor do I have any personal interest in Angel Med Flight, so that when I say they could be role models for expert customer service, efficiency and patient care, know that it comes from a grateful Mother's heart!!!

My son had a valid reason in writing, and all Virgin America asked me to do is scan and email them the paper that stated my son needed to be in Michigan. They actually refunded me half of his airfare and put it in his Elevate account. Then two days before Christmas, my son missed his flight in LAX, Virgin America was kind, considerate and for $50 they placed him on a confirmed stand by flight the next day. What SERVICE! I believe Virgin America is the only airline I have seen in decades that truly understands that they are in a service business. Remember when flying was actually fun? My son is almost 6'4"" and the first time he flew with Virgin, he actually text me from the plane before take off and said what great service they have, and the seats were high enough that they actually were comfortable for him.

1761,"What an innovative way to give the gift of flight!!  I found out about Skyhour when we were creating our gift registry for our wedding.  I'm surprised no one had come up with this idea yet and put it into action! Buying someone an airline ticket as a gift was difficult because the transaction relied on knowing when and where the person wanted to travel.  And, if you only wanted to contribute toward a ticket and not the whole thing, your only option was to just give cash -- not very gift worthy or inspiring!  With Skyhour you know that you are giving them the gift of travel and they are free to use it how and when they want. We received several Skyhours from our wedding registry, and have already used them to visit family (which is another great reason to give -- you can 'nudge' the recipient to use it to come see you!!).  The booking process was easy, and although it's not like booking on standard travel sites, there were plenty of flights to chose from on our preferred airline and we still got most of the benefits from our premier status on that airline.  For first time or infrequent travelers, the options available will make it easy to book and fly.  But for more experienced travelers like me, even though I didn't find the same level of schedule options that I do when I book direct, the act of redeeming a loving gift and getting a flight for 'free' made those differences a non-issue! Looking forward to my next Skyhour flight!!",Postive

They released the ticket, but 3 days later my card information I used to purchase the ticket was used for numerous fraudulent transactions. This is obviously not a real business. Like any other company, the extra fees for booking would have been included in the original transaction. Instead it's clear now they just wanted my card information, separate from the legal transaction, to be used for the fraudulent ones. We should have realized.

1838,"I was a recent victim of an internet fraud perpetrated by FareKingdom. This is the same fraud described in all the legitimate reviews below. All positive reviews for this company is fake. I want to document it here so that I can share this with other consumers as well as the companies that are unknowingly involved. I think this also raises an interesting ethical debate for advertising platforms. The story: I recently needed to change an existing United Airlines reservation last minute for a business trip. I performed a Google search for “United Airlines Customer Service” and was served an ad by a company called Farekingdom. In my haste, I just saw “United Airlines 24*7 support” and a phone number, which I clicked on. Note that I do not get this ad when searching on the desktop platform, only on my mobile browser. I assume Farekingdom has found that the desktop search ads are ineffective, the users are paying more attention and it is easier to disambiguate the ad from an actual United Airlines result. Moreover, you would be able to see the organic result on the same screen as the ad. I proceeded to have a conversation with a Farekingdom agent who pretended to be a United agent. He gave me expensive rebooking options and a call back number. Since my flight was booked by a 3rd party via a travel agent (Cornell University via Frosch Travel) I decided to contact Frosch travel directly to make the change. During the phone call with Frosch, the agent needed to check with United Airlines about fees before rebooking the flight. Since the Frosch agent could not get through, I provided him with the call back number. I stayed on the line for almost a 2 hour phone call, most of which involved the Frosch agent being on hold with the fake United agent (I presume the hold was so that the Farekingdom agent could get through to United and change the flight for free). During this entire call, the Frosch agent also believed he was speaking with a United representative as the person identified himself as such. Eventually, the Frosch agent received a credit card authorization email and asked me to reply to both parties to confirm charges. I do. I then hung up waiting for a call back from Frosch once everything is confirmed. About 45 minutes later, I get a call (7144539656) from someone who identified himself as the agent who was speaking with Frosch. I assumed him to be a United representative. He informed me that the flight that I wanted to book had no confirmed seats, but it would be $1109.60 (the previous cc auth was for 1259.60). I agreed, the money wasn’t important since this was business travel to be reimbursed. After my trip, I went to retrieve a receipt to get a reimbursement. I couldn’t find one in my email inbox. When I looked up my credit card bill, I found a charge from CheapFlightFares.com for the amount stated on the previous phone call. This is the first time I have ever heard of this company. This got me concerned. I reached out to Frosch travel who contacted United. It turns out, United had changed my flight for free and Frosch never charged me. I then reported the charge as fraudulent with American Express and also filed a complaint with Cheapflightfares.com (I’ve yet to hear back from them, since they are likely owned by the same people who own Farekingdom). After filing the dispute with Amex, I started digging. This is when I went back to look at my Google ad and search history to find that I was served an ad by Farekingdom just before calling (18004209694) what I thought to be United customer service. I looked up this company and quickly came across negative reviews on BBB and Trustpilot claiming the same fraud being perpetrated. The manager response to these reviews are always along the lines of “we clearly state that we are Farekingdom.” I decided to call Farekingdom back and recorded the conversation. On the phone call, they are clearly misrepresenting themselves over the phone (just wait for their excuse in their imminent reply that this agent is ""ruining"" their reputation - if they're so concerned, this wouldn't happen repeatedly). I ask them if I’m speaking with United Airlines customer service, to which they responded “we are a consolidator for United Airlines.” I then ask them, how come I got their phone number when I search for United Airlines customer service and what it mean to be a “consolidator for United Airlines.” To this, the person responded “United sends us their overflow customer service calls.” I’ve contacted United, they have no such agreements. United ticket fraud is currently investigating Farekingdom's practices. A few days later, I get another call from the first person I spoke to at Farekingdom (“Philip” @ 7144539656). This time, he asks why did I dispute the charge with bank. This was particularly interesting since the charge was by *Cheapflightfares.com* and not Farekingdom, leading me to believe that the two are one and the same or operate on some commission scheme. During the call, Philip said they purchased the rebooked flight from Cheapflightfares.com – strange considering they are supposedly a travel agency. But of course, this all makes sense, since they need to make money off the fraud while distancing themselves from the charge. During the call, Philip also said, “if you don’t want the charge, we won’t charge you.” Um… okay… this totally reinforces your legitimacy /sarcasm/. So I dug a little further, determined to figure out who is behind this fraud. Cheapfares.com hides behind a proxy domain registrant, domainsbyproxy.com. If you look up this business, they are linked to many other frauds. When registering Farekingdom.com, however, these fraudsters were not as clever. The registrant was listed under the email Mohan7476 at gmail. If you look up this email (the email is also linked to a lot of other travel sites), you’ll find that it belongs to one Mohan Pal Singh, and that this person registered the business, Farekingdom Travel Services, in India. Curiously, their about page claims that the business operates from Las Vegas (their ""global headquarters""). This Las Vegas address is a PO Box at one of these shipment shops. I’ve now reported this fraud to Google Ads, American Express, United Airlines, BBB, and the FTC. I hope this type of fraud can be eliminated in the future. Also, I guarantee that as soon as Farekingdom is able to create some more accounts, there will be a slew of positive reviews written to force negative comments off the top of the page. Good luck getting anyone to believe you.",Negative

1840,"I googled “Air Canada Reservations” and FareKingdom's phone number was the second link to come up listed as a number to call the airline directly (Note: It looks legitimate at first. They even use the logos.) The “agent” I spoke to acted as though he worked for Air Canada and pulled up my reservation.. he told me my flight couldn’t be changed and that if I wanted to arrive to Vancouver as planned I would have to book through another airline, American Airlines to be specific. He even went so far as to tell me he was giving me a deal. Foolishly I provided my debit card information for them to book me on a different airline, but as he was working on booking me I began doing my own research. I found the same flight for $305 through the company website and questioned the significantly higher cost he quoted me. The agent tried to prevent me from booking myself at the lower cost and then argued with me about canceling the transaction. He informed me that the flight with American Airlines was canceled and that I wouldn’t be charged. When I checked my back account later.. I was charged $305.73 for an American Airlines flight (for which I never received information) and a $200 travel service fee. When I called the phone number (800-420-9694) back to no surprise they couldn't find record of my information. They assured me that they would call me back in “4 hours” after doing their own research on my claims. They never called. I called back and with persistence was told by ""Robin Smith"" I would receive a refund if I removed my review with the Better Business Bureau. I was not keen on this recommendation and called back to discuss it with ""Robin"" and was hung up on 3 times by ""Ricky"" and ""Nikki"" when I asked for a manager. They went as far as to tell me ""Robin Smith"" didn't work there and that they were not FareKingdom. They even gave me the phone number to ""FareKingdom"" which was actually the number to a mall in India. I also noticed they had changed their online advertising and the way they answered their phones as soon as my review with the BBB was placed. I then called Raj, the VP of Sales, at a different phone number (866-507-3967). He assured me a refund and a few days later my money was actually returned. The only reason I believe my money was returned was due to my persistence and unwillingness to give up, but I am pleased to have my money back.",Negative
1841,"This is FAKEKINGDOM. This are another Indian Scammers. These people are Fraud, absolutely STAY AWAY. They make sure their phone number appears first on google as soon as you type any airline. I typed Air Canada Contact and didn't realize it is Farekingdom as they have Air Canada logo and at first it looked like Air Canada website. I called to reschedule my cancelled Air Canada flight, at no point they mentioned that they are not from Canada. Due to this Scam Artists I end up paying $2, 100 for return flight which should  have been free. They first made sure to cancel my Air Canada booking. Later on when I realized it was not Air Canada I called them back to cancel my transaction with them, at that point the Supervisor started yelling on the phone and asked me to never call them. This is the customer Service from FAREKINGDOM Supervisor. Agent Name Brandon even told me during conversion to directly call him on a 1-800 number to ensure I do not call Air Canada. My advice to people please double check number before dialing. FAREKINGDOM is known to take advantage of people who are stranded and panicked. Let me know if there is any regulatory authority in USA to report travel agent Scams I would be happy to report these scammers. I highly doubt they are operating from USA, it seems like this people are operating a from remote corner from India.",Negative
1842,"This COMPANY IS FRAUDULENT!!!! DO NOT TRUST STAY CLEAR FROM THIS COMPANY!!!! My flight was canceled and the first thing I do is search united airlines customer service. The first number that popped up was a 1-800 number, automatically assumed this was the correct! WRONG ASSUMPTION it was the number of FAREKINGDOM. This company pretended to be united airlines and I gave them my credit card information. They said that they would call me back to confirm the flight change. I realized this number was not united airlines. They sent an email in which they  wanted me to say “I agree” to confirm the transaction of 75 USD fee for flight change. I DID NOT SAY I AGREE to the email, I also called them and told them I do not want to proceed because they are not United Airlines. They responded saying they are consolidators of united airlines and said that they already charged my card. My so called travel agent was “DARREN FRENCH” – he was yelling at me on the phone, raising his voice, telling me he did me a favor by booking my ticket, saying it was the last seat available and the earliest flight. Next thing I do is I call the ACTUAL UNITED AIRLINES COMPANY they told me that the FAREKINGDOM should not have charged me a fee because the FLIGHT WAS CANCELLED and it was supposed to be FREE!! They also told me that there were no transactions of $75 US from there history. Therefore, farekingdom took my information I gave them impersonated as me to change my flight- which was free. THIS COMPANY IS COMMITTING FRAUD- they acted like they were from united airlines and claimed it was united airlines who is charging me the $75 USD – WHEN IT WASN’T. I also then asked united airlines if this was the last flight and last seat available – they said NO and there were other seats available. I then post a review about this company – about the horrible experience I have had. The agent DARREN calls me the next day and tells me to remove it and he will refund me my money. I removed the post and he never refunded me the money. Then I email him and ask him for an update he says I need to send him my account number,  routing number, billing address, account holder name, name of the bank.  This was very suspicious and essentially he wanted to scam me AGAIN. This Darren French just continuously just kept lying and lying. They lie to people and take their hard earned money away from them for no good reason. This so called company FAREKINDGOM claims they are travel agency – they are NOT they are con artists and they are scamming people and committing fraud. STAY AWAY FROM THEM.",Negative
1843,"Farekingdom.com is a scam company that will take your money in everyway they can.  They posed as United Airlines on both a phone number google search and when called.  They booked flights on Delta Airlines  because they said they couldn't book the requested flight on United.  Thinking they did this as a courtesy, the flight was booked and paid for by credit card.   The flight itinerary and confirmation number was emailed and looked legitimate but the language regarding terms etc were poorly written.  I became suspicious and did research on farekingdom.com and discovered many unhappy customers who said this company is a scammer. I wanted to confirm with Delta Airlines if indeed there was a reservation as represented and found that there was a reservation for some of the correct flights but also for multible flights out of the United States.  The transaction was for a round trip from Sacramento California to Portland Maine!   I called Farekingdom and asked to cancel this reservation and that I wanted a full refund.  I was told ""no"" and was given numerous reasons why they couldn't refund.  Delta Airlines informed me that they received a personal check for $383.40 from Faresbucket LLC?

Called me back on an unknown number telling me that I was suppose to be charged that. Asked for a refund and was hung up on. These people will hang up on you if you question them. I called the real American Airlines and they said I should have not been charged and that there was no note of a charge. So the guy took 70 dollars from me to pocket for himself.

I got stuck at the airport in Lisbon for almost 24 hours but because it all happened a while ago and because it wasn't clear who was responsible, I didn't have much hope of getting compensated.

1926,"Even with the transport strikes, I would strongly advise anyone slightly debating using Le Bus to use the trains instead. Here’s my experience: Firstly me and my girlfriend had to wait for 1hr and 30mins to actually get on the bus at CDG airport. Two buses we put our cases on and when we reached the driver, we were told there was not more room. We then had to persuade him not to drive off and open the luggage hold for us to get our cases off. Once we were finally on, our way, after buying return tickets to the Eiffel Tower from the bus driver, we arrived at the Arch De Triumphe, to be told that the bus would be terminating there. We, along with many others, were wanting to go to the Eiffel Tower bus stop, and we tried to communicate with the driver but he simply pointed to the top of the tower and advised us to walk in that direction. Despite actually buying tickets to the Eiffel Tower and the driver not saying anything, we were left stranded in the middle of Paris, on our first visit there, with two suitcases and no one to advise us where to go. We watched the bus drive off with the Eiffel Tower sign still on the front of it. Then on the way back to the airport, hoping the first trip was an anomaly, we got on the bus at 16:30 and arrived at the airport at 18:50. Yes, over 2 hours for an advertised 60/70 minute journey. It was rush hour, and it is understandable to get caught in the traffic, but what isn’t understandable is the driver stopping for 30 minutes for no apparent reason. When we returned home, we sent in a complaint form and after two weeks, we are still waiting for a response. I have tried phoning them too, but after 1 minute and 30 seconds, the call ends. Le Bus Direct is a great idea but is very poorly executed. If this is your only option, please don’t expect to get where you want to go in the time frames advertised. Give yourself at least an extra hour on top of what you need, especially on the way to the airport.",Negative
1927,"We took the bus from RLY to CDG on February 11th. At our stop at Terminal 2EF it turned out another passenger took our suitcase and left theirs behind. Le Bus Direct asked us to wait for 2h, assuming the other passenger would notice their mistake and return the suitcase. This however did not happen, resulting in us continuing to AMS without our luggage. This where things got worse. They wrongly informed me they found the suitcase. I had to pay for the return shipment, while they don't have a luggage system in place at all. There is no check whatsoever who takes which suitcase. On the day of shipment it turned out there was no luggage, or rather, it was the suitcase of the other passenger (same model, different color, tag, etc.). For five weeks I have been told they tried finding my suitcase without luck. When I told them I want to file a claim and no longer wait, they gave me the other passenger's details, which were on the suitcase (""maybe you can find more information""). To my GREAT surprise, those detailes included a PHONE NUMBER. It took me literally FIVE minutes to contact the other passenger and find out what happened. Now, two weeks later, the suitcase is returned home by Air France. It would have been less than a week if Le Bus Direct contacted the passenger immediately, such that my suitcase wouldn't have been flown between several airports for no reason. I will NEVER use this company again. Besides the above, the timing is rediculous. On the way to our destination, CDG to RLY for transfer, the bus was perfectly on time and frequent. However on the return, when the suitcase was lost, we waited for 1.5 hours before a bus actually stopped (several drove by with same line number, empty) to transfer us. We had sufficient transfer time, but many people did not accomodate for this. Saying the bus runs every 20-30 minutes and only having one in 1.5 hours is unacceptable if your main purpose is to transfer people from one flight to another!",Negative
1928,"Had bought a tricket for 31 euro from CDG to gare de Lyon, but the bus didn't stop at gare de Lyon, but at gare montparnasse. I had to pay 17 euro for a taxi back to gare de Lyon. When i ahould back to CDG the bus never  came and I had To pay 50 euro for a taxi to CDG.",Negative

2001,Worst website for booking dummy tickets They mention there website that after booking tickets valid at lest 7-8 days .. but they do fake promise when I check my ticket next day the ticket is showing canceled.. so please do not book any booking with them,Negative
2002,I booked hotel for tonight 21.09.2019 They deduct payment from my card but when i reached hotel they said we don’t have any booking for you. I called customer service but they also failed to give any positive answer just informed their manager will contact but until now no one contacted me. Looks no one is serious in this company. Called many times no positive answer from customer service only say until now we are working on it even though half night is passed. Very very disappointed if it was not compensatedi will take severe action,Negative
2003,"I would give them less than one star if I could. I purchased two AirFrance tickets from them on 1/3/18, one for me and an extra seat to accommodate size. AirFrance told me on 11/15/18 they are refunding my extra seat ticket price, and to contact flying.com for my refund. I have emailed them NUMEROUS times, and they will not respond. There is no phone number anywhere on their website to contact them. This is not a small amount of money....it is over $700. This is a scam, pure and simple. They are just keeping the money that is mine by rights.",Negative

We found out 2 days before the flight.  The flight was still available, of course, but at a different price and flying.com was unwilling to issue the ticket and eat the difference.  I had to scramble to rebook directly from the airline at double the initial price.  The company denied all responsibility and blamed British Airways, but given the other similar complaints, I find that highly unlikely.  I filed a complaint with the BBB and will be leaving this feedback everywhere I can find.  I would encourage others to do the same.",Postive

2008,"WORST portal ever to book flight tickets!!!! My Trip Number: MF165264018 My experience from yesterday: Booked flight tickets (~$1250) got immediate successful booking message but with ticket status as Pending. It has been 20 hours since booking and I haven't received any ticket confirmation yet. On top of it my reservation, for which I have successful transaction receipt, is not even searchable in flying.com portal anymore (unlike yesterday). The transaction is still reflecting on my credit card and thus I have no idea at all whether I am going to get a ticket or not. So, I can't even book the ticket from somewhere else. It's been more than 24 hours now and I haven't received any ticket confirmation yet. BEST PART: Their customer care is I guess only one person with no way to escalate. She just makes false promises and commits of reverting in next 2 hours and then she does the same every 2 hours. She just puts everything on finance department which is not available for the whole day in this case. She doesn't even have a way to contact so-called ""financial dept"" apart from just leaving them a note. She doesn't even know what are their financial department's working hours. When you write to them and at their portal multiple times (I did 4-5 times), you might get lucky and get a response which is completely USELESS which say 'keep waiting'",Postive

I asked him to correct it and he said he had and they would have it recorded at the airlines.  I called American and they had no idea what I was talking about.  At the airport, I had to go extra early to get my name/ticket corrected.  Then my flight was delayed which made me miss my connection. I called Paul to find out how to get rebooked etc. and he told me to go to customer service and these are the pains of traveling. I know that!  I never got the flight details for my flight in Brazil and I was emailing as I couldn't check in on line because the airline couldn't locate me.  Finally he emailed and said he bought it through Expedia gave me itinerary number.  The price was good but the service and total lack of communication and f/u were terrible.  Unnecessary stress and this is coming from someone who travels 130plus days per year. I would suggest looking at a different low cost agency as I am sure prices are comparable but would hopefully have the essential communication necessary to ensure a good experience.",Negative

2126,Yes they have gone bust and it looks as if we will not get the more than $4600 back from them for booking alternative flights following their cancellation back in July. (I find the recent surge in positive reviews of Primera on TripAdvisor suspicious - I wonder if Primera staff has been busy posting these?),Negative
2127,We booked flights from Stanstead to Boston return a month ago to be sent an email 2 weeks ago to say due to operational reasons they were cancelled but can offer a refund or alternative flights...as we had already booked time off work we chose alternative flights to New York instead...so change car hire and hotels only to find out via the BBC News that as of tonight Primera Air have ceased trading!....looking through all these reviews it’s no wonder but wish I knew before hand...we have managed to book similar flights with an alternative airline at extra cost but don’t know if we will get a refund from Primera if they have run out of money 😕,Negative
2128,"Bare bones accommodation but I knew that when I purchased our tickets. Unacceptable was canceling our flight from Paris to Newark. We found out by watching the status change from ""on time"" to cancelled on the airport monitor screen. Employees were clueless and offered nothing and no explanation. Now, a month later, we receive an email that we can get a Primera credit for our ticket costs but it must be used within 6 months (we never want to fly with them again) OR give them our bank routing info and they'll credit us. I don't trust them with anything, much less my bank info. Why can't they issue a check or refund the credit card we used? Perhaps this email is a scam anyway . . . Run away now.

Then didn't fly direct as paid for, we flew to Iceland to refuel. Landed in Newark 5 hours later then should have. Missed connections and had to pay a huge taxi bill. Not enough food or provisions on the flight out, tiny and cramped plane. Flight back was direct and with a new plane but same old delays taking off and arriving back. No staff to be found at the airports when arriving or departing. Customer service non existent. One reply received to all of my emails which was grammatically incorrect, contained spelling errors and blatantly lied as to why there had been issues. Still have not received the money back I paid 6 months ago for seats I did not received - not to mention any compensation. It takes a lot to infuriate me but please be warned - DO NOT USE THIS AIRLINE. Dreadful service in every single aspect",Negative

We have a written agreement from them that we will have our reimbursement of 3031,82 EUR by 18th of September but have not heard from them since. We have spent £3450 on new travel and £600 on the original flights with Primera and have not got a penny back. They have now gone into administration and declared bankrupt. We are taking on legal action. I am a final year student and this is money from a years savings for my house deposit so you can empathise how stressful this situation has been for me.",Negative

This cost me 30€ for one very small meal, I asked for a glass of water to go with this and was told that water cost extra. On equivalent low cost services I received not only alcoholic beverages but two meals. Asking for a receipt for this cost and I've received nothing after 2 weeks. I didn't know customer service this rubbish still exists.",Negative

2138,Originally booked United using FF miles from EWR to CDG. A few weeks later I saw Primera had a better schedule allowing us to leave CDG one day earlier which was more convenient for our post cruise departure. I cancelled United and paid a $250 penalty. A month later Primera canceled our flight back from Paris so I had to rebook on United at what was now a much higher price. Avoid this unreliable company. You've been warned!,Negative
2139,"We were delayed for 30 hours in Malaga airport, no accommodation was provided. It is now nearly 3 months later and we have not received any compensation owed.

2140,I called 888-981-2111 and spoke to Zayne to book my flights.  He told me that I would be receiving an email with the E-tickets within 4 hours.    Not true.  I called their company daily within a 4 day span and spoke to different reps each time.  I got a different story each but they kept guaranteeing that I would be receiving the E-tickets shortly.  On my last call the new rep said that my ordered had not been completed and that if I wanted to re-book my flights it was going to be almost $448.00 more.  I did not re-book with these scammers! Now my concern is that this company stole my personal information and will use it.   I called my credit card to let them know and I also had to call the 3 different credit bureaus to freeze my account. Don't ever try to save a few bucks because in the end it could cost you a lot more.,Negative

When I asked the airline for flight refund, they just discarded my appeal, simply stating that I don't have any value left on my ticket. Almost after two years, I came to know about Tripmole tool from one of my friends; so, out of excitement I entered my ticket and confirmation number on Tripmole and was almost surprised by the result. It showed that my partially used flight ticket still have a good amount left, which I can claim to get back. With this vital information, I filed my claim again and within few days, I got my refund. Tripmole offered an amazing service and the best part is that it's FREE yet it's a professional service from their part. Now, I can say, I am a big fan of Tripmole.",Postive

2178,"In remembrance of my father, I would like to thank the entire Advanced Air Ambulance team for their exceptional service in organizing the medical air ambulance transportation for my father from Los Angeles, California to Miami, Florida. My family and I traveled to LA escaping Hurricane Irma in September of 2017. Unfortunately, due to dehydration he fell sick and went to a local hospital. This hospital neglected in his care and he ended up with multiple organ failure and bed bound for 4 months and 9 days in California until we were fortunate to arrange my father’s air ambulance to come back home to us. Mr. Abbara made it his personal commitment to making sure all my Father’s needs were taken care of with uttermost urgency, respect, quality, and 100% supervision. He understood the fragile state my father was in and ensured that every detail of our transportation was executed diligently. Mr. Abbara and his team worked with us every step of the way from the moment I made the first call to the end date when my father landed in Miami safely.  The team at Advance Air Ambulance specifically the crew members were extremely professional and handled the coordination of transportation in a first-class manner. My father and I were both comfortable in the air ambulance and had no issues during our trip back home. The entire staff made sure our trip was easier under the very stressful circumstances we had faced in California with my father’s health condition. I am so grateful to have met the team and so glad they were able to fulfill my father’s last wish to come home. My father was hospitalized immediately in Miami and remained bed bound for another 5 months until he passed on June 20, 2018. The respect and honor the team saluted my father upon landing and upon his death was heartwarming and will never be forgotten. I highly recommend Advance Air Ambulance to everyone for their medical transportation needs as you will be in good hands every step up the way and your investment will not be wasted.",Postive

2182,"On 8th Jan 2018, I had purchased from Konasth Solutions Pvt Ltd/ Journeycook.com, British Airways ticket number: 125 5126794536 from New Delhi to Toronto for a sum of Rs 38,900/- for travel on 1st March 2018, which I subsequently requested Mr. Nishant Bajaj, the dealing executive at Konasht Solutions to cancel on the 18th Feb, about ten days before departure. As per agreed terms at the time of purchase, I was told by Mr. Bajaj that in case of a ticket cancellation, a sum of Rs 8000/- would be deducted by British Airways, with a GST at Rs 1440/- and an amount of Rs 150/- as service charge by Konasth Solutions Pvt Ltd/Journeycook.com, bringing the total to a sum of Rs 9590/- to process the refund, and that the refund would be transferred in to the Client’s bank account within two weeks of initiating the same. However, this was just the beginning of a harrowing experience to obtain the refund, with a partial payment at that.  At first, for some unfathomable reason the Company tried different means to delay and not initiate the refund by coming with lame excuses that their Servers were down, hence they couldn’t give a confirmation of refund via mail. After being repeatedly told the same over a few days, I eventually visited their office and upon request got a signed and stamped confirmation of the amount of refund to be initiated. Subsequently, I had to leave for abroad, and was no longer available in Panchkula to visit the Company office and to follow up with the refund, and had to send  numerous e-mails and messages as reminders, many of which went unanswered, it finally  took Konasth  Solutions Pvt Ltd/ Journeycook.com over two months to transfer a partial payment of Rs 27, 400/- with false assurances by the Company that it would be done ‘shortly’. Eventually, they withheld an amount of Rs 1910/-, which when asked for the reason for the same, Mr. Bajaj could not come up with anything except that it would transferred ‘shortly’. It’s been now close to four months and they have yet to transfer the balance amount. All email correspondence was also copied to Senior executives of the Company, Mr. Sanchit Bansal and Mr. Sahil, however even they at their level chose to ignore the issue rather than remedy it. Two things stand out, the first why did the Company not live up to its commitment of refunding the amount owed within two weeks of cancellation and instead have taken till date close to four months. The second, while the final amount owed was insignificant, why did they not refund the same especially so as it was mentioned in a signed and stamped document. The reason for the narration of this episode is to highlight the petty and poor standard of professionalism of Konasth Solutions Pvt Ltd/ Journeycook.com, coupled with unscrupulous means of duping gullible clients and then causing them harassment to no end, especially in this case they took advantage knowing that the Client had left the country and that would not be able to personally pursue the case for a full refund. This speaks of poor ethos and petty tactics to achieve short term gains while ignoring professional customer relations. I would strongly advise caution to prospective Clients while initiating a deal with them. This is not a personal assault on Konasth Solutions Pvt Ltd/Journeycook.com, but a candid narration of the interaction one had, so that prospective clients are forewarned against experiencing a similar scenario.",Postive

2270,"Same old story - booked a flight, Lufthansa cancelled it, I asked for a refund. This was back in March. It took four months to process it. To Lufthansa's credit, that's a month quicker than KLM took, which isn't saying much. At least I've got my money back now. I would probably give 2 stars except for Lufthansa's really creative excuse they gave for rejecting my chargeback request back in May. Pages and pages of documentation explained that, if I had boarded the imaginary flight (the one that was cancelled), and then decided to leave the airport and enter Austria for some reason (which I wasn't planning to - it was a stopover!), I would have violated the EU travel restrictions (that were not even in place when the flight was cancelled in early March!). But surely they still have to refund me, right? No, you see, in order to prevent me from committing a crime, they had cancelled my flight for me, and they carefully explained that since I might have committed a crime (entering a country illegally), they did not have to give me my money back. That's a really bad thing to say to a customer. Also total nonsense. It's weird that eventually I got my money back anyway. It kind of sounds like they were making stuff up just to stall for time, doesn't it? Surely not.",Negative
2271,I can only say they are the worst at document controle. Pick out of the line of 100+ and was the only one to be denied to fly to Canada. I was non essential...so the other 100+ were all essential passagiers? No way. They are bad at there job.,Negative

2273,Flights from Stansted to izmir via Munich and the same return trip were rearranged by this hopeless airline so that we actually arrived in Munich 3 hours after our connection had left.... And they asked us if this was acceptable. As it obviously wasn't we asked for a refund. This was 7 weeks ago and we have been unable to contact lufthansa again. Looking at other peoples experiences it seems that the company have taken the 9 billion given to it by the German government and decided to keep it for themselves rather than refund their customers. We will never use them again as so many other people on here have said so hard to see how this airline can survive when all it has done is drive their customers away.,Negative
2274,"Still waiting for the refund of a long-haul booking which got canceled in March. I do understand that this is a very difficult time for the aviation industry but the airline has had extremely poor communication, which I did not expect from Lufthansa that I had known. I have called countless times and have been given different information each time. I was even promised by an agent to receive my refund in 7 working days, yet it has been weeks. Another time, I've been told that I was also refunded through PayPal (which is false). Last time, I was told that my ticket number has changed which is why the refund was not processed. At this point, I have doubts about receiving my refund at all and will be submitting my case to the Agency for Passenger and Passenger Rights (apf).",Negative

But... then they had all this money people payed for nothing and they didn't want to return it so: -No money back for cancelled flight. -No information about cancellation. -No customer support (only an email and they don't reply). -Rufuse to confirm any information I'm told over the phone by email (I have to contact customer support, that I have done multiple times). -No information on their website regarding the situation. Bad customer service = unhappy customers and it's your own fault Lufthansa. Hope you get fined in the EU court.",Negative

They should all be fired for putting passenger lives in danger!",Negative
2279,"Typical Covid-19 experience: Flight canceled by Lufthansa in March, difficult to reach customer services, very long wait on refund (19 weeks!). 2 stars instead of only one, because at the end of the day I did receive a full refund without needing to argue. Long wait, difficulties reaching customer services and their inability to provide concrete information on how the process will commence were my reasons for withholding more stars.",Negative

Chargeback made, currently effective, pending any inaccurate response to the chargeback. If an inaccurate   response is made challenging the chargeback, I will immediately proceed to a statutory demand for an admitted debt, followed by a winding up petition.

She refused to apologise for delay and misinform, and then hung up the line despite I'm calling from my pocket . They cancelled the flight amid covid 19 and as per rude lady they will refund on my card and should wait till end of November before contact again and its proceed from today 3rd August . The airline was miserable as they requested from Dublin Airport that i need to collect my  another  flight ticket on transit ( Munich or Frankfurt)   despite that OmanAIR give  me both tickets for whole trip when I return to Dublin . They also don't have fleets/airplanes from Germany to Muscat or Vise versa and chose to force passengers to get OmanAIR planes . They have only Dublin-Frankfurt/Munich and Vise versa and our miles rewards doesn't count to Muscat from Germany or Vise versa. I was only forced to book with them because of convient transit waiting time despite KLM was far better in other aspects . Now I have to wait another 4 months By the way the lady asked me about ticket number many times and when it become correct she didn't say ok now can you please tell me your name but immediately she said and what's your name I have to look at your file only when I asked her was the number correct?

Almost 2 months later, no answer to any of my emails or phone calls (the ones that you wait hours in a line). Simply embarrassing, the next step is report the company.",Negative

I asked the representative I spoke to if I would get an email confirmation of the transaction. He replied that they were backed up and to wait a few days. A few days went by, nothing came. The 800 number rang busy for hours so, as I am fluent in Italian, I called the Lufthansa number listed for Italy. It took a few tries, but eventually I was able to speak to a representative. He wasn’t able to find any trace of the payment I had made over the phone. He gave me the email address and suggested I write customer support explaining that I was the victim of a possible FRAUD. Customer support did follow up but claimed they found no proof of fraud.......I continued to email them explaining what happened, and finally in June they agreed, IT WAS A FRAUDULENT CHARGE. Finally a few weeks ago I was told the amount would be credited back to my credit card. As of today I am waiting. Moral of the story, think twice before giving your credit card information to a representative who answers the Lufthansa 800 number, even if you initiate the call.",Negative

The project had unexpected challenges that the team at Blue Skies handled like professionals.  I also had them perform and conditional inspection (annual) and prop balance.

Absolutely disgusting service and frankly, the Swiss Government should step in and try to save the reputation of the company and the country. But that won't happen.

2316,"I've purchased two tickets in January 2020 (pre-COVID) for a flight in September, for a total of 85 EUR per ticket plus 37 EUR of Special service on-flight. Plans had to change (because COVID, of course) and they advertised a bonus of 50 EUR and cost-free change for my reservation, per ticket. The limit for changing the ticket placed at 31/08 for a flight before end of 2020. Policy quite restrictive compared to other airlines, but it is what it is. So I was obliged to make changes and find an alternative that fit my new plans in 2020. Called them yesterday 11/08. An operator ensures me about the change, all is good, I even get a partial reimbursement from the unused part of the 50 EUR bonus. I get no confirmation email after a day, so I call again today 12/08 and discover their lies. Nothing was done the previous day, the operator gave me false information and did no change on my reservation. The new guy talking with me tells me I now can change my flight BUT... NO Bonus as they advertised, because it covers only the ticket part not the taxes. He tells me it's because taxes aren't Swiss' money. But then he says NO reimbursement for the 37 EUR of service I had asked for the previous flight. Isn't that Swiss' money?? They practically stole that from me. The operator says I am making a voluntary change (yeah, ignoring that everyone's plans changed in 2020). He also asks the name of the other operator (I have to know that? You have a terminal with calls tracking...). I answer him they even changed the time of the previous flight and didn't offer any opportunity to get a reimbursement for that (as Turkish and many other companies did). So I end up having to pay and extra 16 EUR per ticket on top of what they already got from me, for a cheaper flight (I was flying classic tariff in the previous, took the light with no luggage for the new one). SWISS AIR is holding customers' cash using COVID excuse and not caring about the consequences. I have had the worst experience with them during this situation than any other airline. I've got full reimbursements from EasyJet, Turkish Airlines, Pegasus Airlines, Alitalia and Wizz Air (even!). SWISS is taking advantage of COVID situation and keeping the money from their customers. Never fly Swiss again. I am disappointed and angry, their policies are worse than any cheap low-cost airline out there.",Negative

I have called multiple times and every person on the phone tells me I have to wait and they do not have a time frame to give me MY money back. I had to go purchase another ticket on another airline and am in the hole thousands of dollars because of them. They manage their money poorly and do not take care of their customers. GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK!,Negative
2318,"It's been over 100 days since my flight should have happened, Swiss quietly deleted flights from our itinerary so we could not cancel, then refused to do anything. After three weeks I got through on the phone and was told of be refunded in three weeks. That was a lie. I then rang again and sent through the online refund form, now Swiss are lying saying they have already refunded me when I've received no money. They're trying to blame the bank?! The bank WANTS them to refund me as I've an open section 75 claim they don't want to be responsible for. HSBC are also useless though. I don't think I'll ever see my money again 😭",Negative
2319,"As per my comment below, another few weeks have passed and I am still waiting for my refund. No word on when that might happen, call centre is jammed and unhelpful, the only thing they will say is that they are paying people back and will get round to me at some point in the future. Could be a week, a month, a year, a lifetime... Just whenever they please, really, in defiance of international law and decency. A very unsatisfactory and dishonest approach which will inevitably do further harm to their brand, making it even more likely that they will fail. At this point, the risk of booking a flight with them is too high to take seriously. You're not going to get your money back if it's cancelled and, with a growing number of passengers vowing never to use the airline again or simply deferring all travel decisions, you also risk losing your fare when they Lufthansa decides to cut its losses.",Negative
2320,Swiss canceled flights multiple times (even 2 days in advance!) and customer service is impossible to reach (re-booking can only be done via hotline - most cheap carriers can do that online already...). Worst experience ever and won't fly with Swiss anymore.,Negative
2321,"Stayed for ages on the service line, to get only part of Swiss cancelled flight shedule issue solved. As outside Switzerland has only phone lines from Mo-Fr office hours, had to call Switzerland, waiting 47min which costs expensive, customer unfriendly. Canceled flights within last minute. Change impacts in extra hotel costs. Did not honour my seat reservation, altough I had paid for. No quality service anymore. Its a shame for my home country, pls change the name & flag of this airline.",Negative
2322,"I arrived at the airport 2.5 hours before the onboarding time. My check-in luggage exceeded 3kg and I told the representative to let me remove a bag of items from the luggage so that it wouldn't be overweight. I have travelled on air many times in my life so I have a bag of unimportant items ready to be removed and even have a friend accompanying us for this purpose. I explained to your staff that I wish to remove a bag of daily items like shampoo and shower gel and more that would be sufficient to meet the requirement. Instead of giving me 30 seconds to do so, she held my luggage hostage and insisted on charging me for an additional fee. I didn't continue to argue with her on rightfully getting my own possession, then the Second problem arose here when I politely inquired about the estimated, if not the exact, price for adding the luggage. She refused to tell me by saying that she did not know and I was again surprised by her rude attitude. She ignored me and went ahead and asked to weight my hand carry and I quickly cooperated. I have travelled many times with this carry on and never had a problem getting it onboard. She said my carry on was oversized, took it and stapled a tag on it without asking for my permission. I then again asked her about the price for this piece and she refused to tell me again saying that she wouldn't know until the computer generated it. Firstly, I know very well that there is a standard additional charge for any oversized/overweight baggage, I only asked her because I didn't remember what was said on the website. This basic information should be well-knowledgeable for your check-in staff. Secondly, the computer had already done the luggage-checking job so I was confused about what else to wait for the computer to get the fees. Thirdly, besides the unprofessionalism, we were being ill-treated by more than one of your staff. During her inappropriate refusal for all my rightful request of having my luggage back for 30 seconds and basic information inquiries, she repeatedly made a scene on the floor by yelling at me ""You are making my life difficult!"" several times. She also gathered with her two more staff to join the bully, and one did not even wear a mask. It was extremely rude for a service provider and highly unacceptable during pandemic time. Lastly, I did not argue with them and let your staff do what they need to do to tell me the final price. she told me that she was going to charge me $173 for the additional 3kg and another $100 to check-in the carry on. I finally got the price and made a decision to not bring the carry-on with me. Your two staff insulted me by making me present to her and her coworker who my friend was and warned us at least 4 times not to bring it onboard as they would know. I again made a promise and cooperated with them the whole time but felt so uncomfortable. The check-in process was already unnecessarily long and torturous, we had to rush to the TSA even if we had arrived so early to the airport. I thought it was over, but when lining up to get onboard, the staff was there again fixating her eyes on us and our items. More than that, there were at least two passengers in line carrying the exact same carry-on with them to go onboard successfully. In conclusion, the original ""problem"" was something cannot be more common at the check-in counter and can be solved under 30 seconds by letting me handle my own possession. Instead, it got escalated to so many unwanted events and we had to live through the whole 30 minutes of embarrassment in public.  I strongly believed that we, and my friend who so kindly accompanied us through the whole three hours, were being treated extremely unfairly and unprofessionally.",Negative

They confirmed receipt of my claim and am still waiting almost 2 months later for a refund or at least an update. Disgraceful company and will have to claim via Section 75 on my credit card.

I called customer service and got oral confirmation that the tickets have been cancelled and I will receive a refund. However, the customer service representative said there will be no confirmation email sent to me, as we would usually expect a confirmation of cancellation email. It has now been almost four months and I am still waiting for the refund. I have called them numerous times. Was told in April that the refund department was closed due to lockdown in Switzerland. I followed up the news and called again when Switzerland reopened. This time the excuse was - refund department is the last one to reopen! Keep waiting! I waited and waited and eventually got told that refund department is now open but too busy. “You need to wait to submit a form to request for refund but the form has not been available yet.”( customer service said) I was so angry about this - you confirmed that I am entitled for a refund but all of sudden I need to APPLY in order to get my refund. What about people who are still waiting for refund but have not called to chase? If they don’t apply AGAIN they will not be refunded? Then I got told because I paid with HK dollars so I need to make special request for the refund. I am furious about this excuse - when I bought the tickets online, you had no issue charging me HK dollars. I would have loved to use an EU currency to pay but the system prompted me to use HK dollars. When it comes to refund I have to go through an extra step to APPLY. How ridiculous! Btw I did offer to receive refund in Euro or pounds but the answer I got is NO. I seriously suspect that Swiss Air is holding the money belongs to passengers and actually NEVER INTENDED to pay it back! I reserve my legal rights to bring claims against Swiss Air to get my money back. And of course, never never use Swiss Air, never!!!",Negative

We were promised a full refund or a voucher during our purchase. A couple of weeks ago our flights got canceled. We called Swiss to rebook to a different destination (Greece). On the site they provide tickets for 225€ but they offered us tickets of 440€. So, they canceled our flights and top of that they want us to pay extra money for a cheaper destination. The customer service doesn’t can’t even answer to our questions, I guess they even feel ashamed working for this airline. We asked for a full refund wich we will probably receive after 6 months. Swiss scammed many many people booking flights that they knew are not going to FLY. Never AGAIN!",Negative
2335,"In 50+ years of flying with countless airlines around the world my experience with Swiss International on the ZRH - LHR route today was by far the worst.  I accept that many things have to be different under Covid 19 but that does not excuse ignoring basic safety rules such as taxiing the aircraft with several passengers (including myself) still standing in the aisle trying to find a space for their bags in the overhead bins!  Also, incomplete seat belt checks; no checking that areas around the seats were clear of obstructions; no asking passengers to place coats, jackets and other small items under the seats instead of in the overhead bins where they were taking up much needed baggage space; no attempt to help passengers cope with one bin that had become jammed part open/part shut (and remained so throughout the flight); no attempt to help passengers who found other people were occupying their pre-reserved seats; no observation of boarding by rows or boarding groups (as indicated on the boarding pass); muffled incoherent boarding announcements as ground staff didn't remove masks when using microphone; seats flimsy with damaged trim and dangerously sharp pieces (tore clothing); very poor seatback storage for papers/magazines etc that included 2 tiny pockets that were too small to even accommodate a standard smartphone; mini-overhead LCD screens that could barely be seen but seemed to show nothing but a Breitling advert and a barely distinguishable route map. And where was the flight safety briefing?????  Admittedly I may have been distracted for a few minutes while trying to find overhead baggage space but I honestly have no recollection of seeing or hearing it!!!  Was it being shown on those mini screens? If so I didn't hear it.  I really had the impression that the cabin crew couldn't be bothered with the basics on this flight.  Only one announcement from the flight deck too and that was when we were beginning our descent.  For those who remember Dan-Air and early generation Aeroflot, they were 5 star operations compared with Swiss International today. Certainly not the Swissair of old and I will definitely avoid in future.",Negative

The employee said that both of our names are not on the list, because we didn't check in, although she could clearly see the booking confirmation and the boarding passes (even with seat numbers!) in the app. Instead of conducting the investigation, they asked us 'how are you willing to pay for a late check-in - by card or cash?'. They told us it's 35£ each, which was even more than tickets' price. Obviously we refused, as we had no idea something was wrong with our bookings - no notification in the app, no email saying we need to check in once again (even though we did check in!). How could we possibly predict this? What was the most upsetting part is not only that they were ignorant to our questions, but that the plane was half empty and they could see our seat numbers, which we showed them in the app. In the end we hopelessly walked away, because they locked the gate in front of our faces. This has ruined all our plans. We were supposed to go back to work the next day after landing in London.

Everything from check in to landing ran smoothly for me, food choice on board is good but could do with a little improvement in terms of offering sandwiches or more hot choices but I find the airline staff and specifically the cabin crew very friendly and professional for a low cost airline.",Postive
2563,"We had a flight booked to Corfu in April but due to the COVID it was cancelled. thats ok, but now we really want to rebook it so we could go in September to anothe destiantion....but....no vouchers. We keep calling for weeks now, the only answer is be patiant, we are busy and you will get your vouchers next week. this is 4th week that we hear this and no vouchers! The worst Customer Support and the company I have ever seen. Also, the paid costs for the language that was supposed to be returned to our bank account has not been done. So lost money for 5 people family and no news, nothing!!! Never ever I would suggest this company to anyone. If there is a rate lower than 0 I would choose that!",Negative
2564,"This morning I have called your customer service. The only thing I wanted was to change destination and return date on my booking. I am completely fine with paying a fee for that change. I was also completely fine with waiting 50 min. on the phone. Understandable in this covid 19 situation. What I do not understand is the fact I had to go through a very specific multiple choice menu. Which I did. When I got to talk to someone, this person seemed less than enthusiastic, which I can maybe understand, they must get 100's of calls per day.  However this person was not the least bit interested in helping me. He said he could not put me through and he was not able to help. He could not even give an answer, as to why he had to put me though a different department, when I already had gone through the multiple choice menu. He said someone would call me within 3 days. When I asked if I would get a notification about a time frame, given that I might not be able to answer, if I do not know when during the day. He just repeated his comment: someone will call me within 3 days. This other flights we want to take might even be booked or get more expensive in the mean time. I must say, this is the worst customer service, that I have ever encountered and I feel like I understand, why you are cheaper than other airlines. I guess you get what your pay for!",Negative

Transavia cancelled my flight and offered some sort of credit with the option of a refund if I hadn't used it in a year. First of all, if the airline goes bankrupt in the next year, I would never see that money. I explained to them I am not from Europe and so I wouldn't be able to use it in the next year and that I wanted my money back now, not in a year, and they continued to refuse despite EU law stating customers are entitled to a refund when the airline cancels. I had to issue a charge back with my credit card company in order to get the refund I was owed. Overall their handling of the coronavirus pandemic has been awful and I am absolutely judging airlines by how they treat their customers right now, so I will not be booking from them ever again.",Negative

We have been flying all these years with them and never had a single issue The latest problem was due to covid flight changes and they refunded us in 5 days An example to follow from other competitors that don't answer the phone don't reply to mails or refund the money at all.

I included a kennel to bring a refugee dog to Holland, which I do three times per year. As Transavia was not clear about flights to be cancelled again or to proceed it was to short to organise the kennel to bring a dog to Holland for adoption. I asked Transavia to cancel the kennel and to send me a voucher of 70 € in order to make a new reservation for a kennel on my next flight. They refused and said you can use it for a seat or luggage. No good as the seat was already given by Transavia because of Corona. No flexibility, whilst I was flexible and did not ask them for any monies back I accepted the voucher in the first place.",Negative

Luke prepared a variety of itineraries to several different countries and different dates.  He was very patient as we changed our minds several times but ultimately he developed an excellent itinerary at a very reasonable price. Unfortunately, after the pandemic struck we had to cancel our trip.  Luke then expended a great deal of effort to get refunds and/or credits and to explain the options available to us even as the airlines changed their refund policies. Without question, I will book our next trip through Luke and we all thank him for the rather thankless job of preparing our itinerary and then getting refunds/credits for us after it was necessary to cancel our trip.  .",Postive

I believe that he did his best In explaining the process and to get me the best fare in the midst of all the uncertainty during the pandemic; however, I’m on the fence about using the service again.  I ended up spending significantly more more than the cost of the original ticket.  I’m left thinking that it might have been more cost effective dealing with one airline and having them rebook a ticket enemy they change the schedule.  Given this experience, I might consider using your service again when traveling is more predictable.",Postive

I should have known better as a frequent flyer, but I was desperate to get a good fare for a comfortable seat on a long overseas trip for a wedding. I was wary enough that when coronavirus struck, I knew we would probably lose our money (a lot of money), but I was able to rebook our tickets for late August with a small increase in the fare and now have had to cancel those due to travel restrictions in France. After trying to rebook and being told the dates I want are unavailable, they offered me a credit, which I do not trust. I continue to press for a refund, and am getting the run around. And, I just discovered the rebooked ticket for August was only a one-way from Paris to LA (when we booked a round-trip from LA to Paris). Don't do it. I think there's a class action suit in the making here. And it's clear these positive reviews are fake if you take more than one second to read them.",Negative

Having never done this before, we weren't sure what to expect. Our flight experience from Sarasota to Sioux Falls on 5/31/20 exceeded all expectations! We were greeted in the lounge by one of the pilots, Alec who took care of our luggage and proceeded to get us comfortably settled in (as if anyone would not be comfortable in the incredibly plush surroundings). He gave us a brief safety overview and we were wheels up 15 minutes after boarding. The attentiveness both he and the other pilot, Fred, displayed were a testament to the quality of this operation. I am a nervous flier, at best, and found I was enjoying myself so much I didn't really want to land! I had packed sandwiches but we enjoyed the complimentary wine and alcohol along with the snacks. Oh, and the restroom was at least twice the size of commercial ones! Upon landing at the private plane terminal, we were unable to get an Uber and Alec offered to get a crew vehicle to drive us home!! A taxi arrived shortly thereafter but his gesture was extremely considerate. So let's review: no TSA, no delays, no contamination from inconsiderate fliers, totally professional and competent crew! We're pretty much spoiled for life! Thank you again for a spectacular experience.",Postive

Well that was ok as nothing was in any1s hand so I had chat with many of there associates Punit,Ravish many other as they kept on saying that it is taking usual than longer time to get the refund however, I got the refund on my wife n son's airline ticket. However my partial used ticket refund is still uncleared whenever I ask they say it gets Manually calculated and hence takes time but it's been 2 n half month m still un answered. About the refund Sadly saying am very disappointed by the aftersale service by Shipra travel/myticketoindia and urge people to be very careful while making a deal because they r very promising while booking ticket which is good but they won't be there when u need it d most.",Negative
2681,I will never be booking the tickets again from mytickets to India.Since last week I am following on the refund and everytime I was being told that either Vandana or Nidhi from refund team will call you but never got a call back. There are enough team members when the new booking is being done but after that no one cares.,Negative
2682,"Vandana was really helpful..I really appreciate your help Vandana for getting all the terms and conditions approved by the airlines..Also,Meenakshi played a awsome role in helping me with the available options.The overall experience was Gr8 and enticing .I would recommend using My Tickets to India for all your domestic and international flight bookings.Thanks. Nikunj Mehta",Negative

2684,"Good Morning! I have regular visits to India with my Family. I need to raise a complaint with you for a ticket booking that was done for me and My Family by Shipra Travels/My Tickets to India.I want to bring to your notice the Fraud and problems faced by me now regarding a ticket booking done by  Shipra Travels/My Tickets to India. I had booked tickets from US to India and return back journey through Shipra Travels on Dec 09 2019 for my family travel on 29th June and for my travel on 13th July to India. Recently I inquired with Shipra Travels for cancellation and Refund of my tickets based on the Corona virus situation. I asked Shipra Travels to raise cancellation of my tickets with Delta Airlines. Shipra Travels said they have raised the request with Delta and will get back to me. Also in parallel I called-up Delta Airlines directly and Delta informed me that the JFK to MUM flight is cancelled by Delta itself, so there will be Refund that should be provided to me. And they said Shipra Travels should raise the Refund with Delta Airlines and I will be refunded in Full amount of $5000 as there is a cancellation of flight by Delta itself and there will be fees cut for any amount. I informed the same to Shipra Travels and in the last week I received an email from Shipra Travels stating wrong and incorrect information that  they got approval from Airline on refund of $ 4800 which will be refunded after a total penalty of USD 200 ( $ 50 per passenger ).  Now Shipra Travels is putting a penalty of $200 for no reason on me and refunding me only an amount of $4800, even though Delta Airlines is giving me a Full Refund of $5000. Please find the original email from Shipra Travels stating the terms and service agreements wherein there is NO mention of any fees/amount that will be cut as a penalty from me. I hope Sir you understand that we are in a very bad situation in the Corona virus pandemic where in we are not sure of our employment and getting our next paycheck. Also there is so much Health risk of me and my family and we are trying our best to stay alive in this worse situations. My younger son is born premature and has a underlying health condition, so we wanted to take care of him in these tough situations and we are trouble din this way for our own money by Shipra Travels. And we wanted to bring to your notice that this indecent behavior by Shipra Travels is not at all agreeable and We need your help and intervention to help stranded people like us. We have already paid our entire amount of $5000 and now Shipra Travels is not giving this Refund back to their Customers even though Delta Airlines has returned the Money in FULL.",Postive

Whether it’s business class seats or economy seats that might be required, the first inquiry should be to Travis. It will probably be the last because he finds what is needed for competitive prices and great airlines and routing. He makes me look like a hero to my colleagues!

2836,"So back in February, I booked two tickets to the Philippines to visit family and explore the motherland. Long behold, the Covid-19 pandemic caused shut downs of international borders for non-citizen, and I knew I had to cancel my flights. So unfortunate, but understandable, for the circumstances. So I contacted their customer service, and they agreed to process a refund for a $100 total charge. I spoke with Heaven, and she agreed to process it. She told me it would take up to 8 weeks from when I cancelled, which was on April 13th, 2020. More than 12 months later, and they keep telling me through my follow-up calls after the 8 weeks, that it's taking longer than usual for the airlines to process my refund. I've never dealt with this long of a delay for any refund, and it's really concerning. They said there's nothing I can do but wait. 3 months later, and still no sign of the refund. Beware before you book!",Negative

My credit card that I used to purchase my ticket a year ago has been paid and I requested to send my refund by check to me but they refused to send my money back. I spoke to Aima Colleen so many times but she never get back to me. They charged me a $300 penalty for canceling it even the scheduled flight was within the Pandemic. They keep insisting they have to refund my credit card even though I explained that I paid all my credit cards and closed it. It doesn’t make sense because the tickets got paid off and I paid off my card too. MangoTours have been giving me a hard time and I won’t recommend it to anyone and won’t be buying any more tickets from them. Very POOR service. Unluckily until now and it has been 5 months and no action has been taken. Please take a note beside the $300 penalty, they still want me to pay another $53 for processing fee and they want me to give them another credit card so they can charge this fee. I am on the process of reporting them to BBB for the Poor service and the way they process the refund.",Postive

Eli responded by telling me I could get a better fare by dealing w/Singapore Air directly since they were having a sale. Love the honesty. He gives U choices of airlines & travel routes & solid advice. The key is flexibility & making fast decisions since the deal can be gone in minutes.

We started looking for tickets three months ago and saved about 50% on a similar business class routing on other airlines. We were flexible on our departure and arrival airports, and had some leeway in our dates. I think this is key in getting the best deal. You also have to be willing to commit to a booking right away, or it will be gone. We lost a better deal because we were slow to decide.

WHAT IS THIS? there is a European law for these compensations and I definitely do qualify for this. furthermore, Claimflights immediately deleted the correspondence from their portal and left me without these details. for me, Claimflights was just a waste of time .... within 10 days I was able to get the full refund from Vueling directly",Negative

Our international flight from the US was canceled 12 hours before its scheduled departure, and we were placed on a new flight that left 12 hours later. Apparently, European passenger rights laws are much stronger than those in the US, and Claimfights, being European based, was able to secure a very sizable compensation for us. Claimflights was very transparent during the process, setting proper expectations for each step. Our claim actually took somewhat less time than we were told. We could easily imagine being stone-walled by the airline had we attempted this ourselves. Instead, we were totally insulated from this- this alone is well worth their fee.",Postive

When you call them to book a flight (which they urge you to do in order to get a cheaper deal) they tell you those flights are no longer available (they cancel the ones you see online and pretend they got booked) and only offered you pricier tickets. I ended up booking a flight through them via Skyscanner and a few weeks later when I arrive at the for my flight, I learn it was 'cancelled'. Turns out the flights never existed and they want you to pay an increased fee to book another flight through them.

What? I never wanted to cancel, they were the one who could NOT (or want not) delivery the reservation. I told he must be out of his mind to think about charging me for their incompetency.

I called the airline to choose seats and they had no record of a reservation.  I called Shiva Travel daily, only to be told it was ""200% confirmed"" and an email would arrive in 48 hours.  They had thousands of tickets in the queue from Labor Day weekend, not to worry...all complete BS.  After a week of calling and emailing multiple times a day demanding my confirmation, I was told I needed to send a copy of my driver's license to accompany my credit card information.  This was a huge red flag as I've never had to do that with any other reservation.  They already had my CC information, and I jokingly asked if they also needed my SSN as this was highly inappropriate.  THEY ARE NOT ENDORSED BY THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU AND HAVE COMPLAINTS ON THERE.  I know the cheaper travel ticket is attractive, but they are scamming people somehow.  I cancelled my trip and told them if I see any charges on my statement I would file charges for fraud. This is a terrible company and one to stay far, far away from.  They never had any intention of booking my flights and they are very condesencing the moment you demand what is yours...and what is standard practice for any travel agency...your confirmed tickets.

I've filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and discovered this company has an ""F"" rating due to 4 previous complaints, all of which went unanswered and unresolved by Shiva Travel. In my last contact with them, they brought up that they knew I posted my review (below) in September and asked me to take it down. I told them I would when they refunded me but even that wasn't enough motivation for them. If you use this company you are taking a huge risk. Be warned. Original review: Would give ZERO stars if I could! Booked flights in January for a May trip. Life happened and my mother passed away unexpectedly. Her services were held on the day we were supposed to fly out. The airline refunded us immediately and in-full, but after 4 MONTHS, 6 EMAILS (all of which went unanswered), and as of today, 7 PHONE CALLS (each ending with the promise that I would receive my refund within a week), Shiva Travel STILL HASN'T REFUNDED the booking fee! Oh, and I found out on the 6th phone call that I would only be given a partial refund... you know service fees for everything they could think of, cutting my ""promised"" refund amount in HALF. You'd think they would at least have compassion for someone who just lost their mother...not. at. all. They also promote themselves as having award-winning customer service, what a joke!

I logged into my American Airlines App to add my new itinerary 2 weeks later and the flight was not found, so I call American Airlines to check on it and Shiva Travel has canceled my flight again and has not notified me.  Everytime I have called they tell me to call back in 2 hours for a manager or a manger will call me.  I have yet to hear from anyone at Shiva Travel and as of today I still do not know if I have a valid flight for 08-30-19.  Very frustrating.

Shiva travel will definitely destroy your trip for you.  If you think that to possibly save a few dollars is worth gambling and not getting your flight then talk with Vince Vance, he's your guy.

When I called, I was told that the agent was on a 1 week vacation and that the ticket was cancelled!  Don't use this travel agency.  They are absolutely terrible and unreliable.",Postive

I specifically asked if the tickets were regular economy or basic economy. I did not want basic economy and would not have booked it. Unfortunately, I now have basic economy tickets. Vance Victor, the agent, kept telling me to wait a few days for the ticket to upgrade to regular economy ""once the ARC processes"".  It never did.  After speaking to another agent, it became clear that they don't seem to understand what Basic Economy is on American Airlines.

3114,"We waited for 40 minutes for a bus driver who never came, ended up getting a lyft, and we missed the flight to our destination. Had to pay fees to change flight. Then when we got back, no bus was around to pick us up, called the office multiple times and ended up having to get a lyft to the lot. Overall it cost me $60 on top of the cost to store my car all because no shuttle driver was there to pick up or drop me off to airport",Postive
3115,After being on two flights in one day all me and my fiancé wanted was to go home. We did as it says to text when ready to get picked up. They responded with yes they’d be there. Unfortunately after close to an hour and about 10 phone calls later (which by the way no one answers and we witnessed the driver watch the phone ring) a shuttle appeared. Once getting on the driver was unapologetic or caring of us telling him we’d been waiting for almost an hour with 3 Marriott vans and three Spot shuttles passing us but no JIFFY to be found. Rates may be good but it comes with a price. Thank God I wasn’t alone. Not the safest place to be at night. 👎👎👎.,Negative

3119,"very good price, but the shuttle to and from and airport reflected the price. going there it was packed requiring people to stand unsafely on the bus. and going home waited over 30min because only 1 driver was working that day. lack of staff on site a major issue. will not be booking here again.",Postive
3120,"Really liked the prices and the service at Jiffy Park.  Shuttle buses ran frequently and the parking lot itself was safe and secure and clean.  The manager (Oliver) was kind enough to explain that since my return flight was changed at the last minute and I came back a day late, I would only be charged the extra day at the discounted rate that I paid. Would definitely use it again",Postive
3121,Online reservations were quick and easy. The only issue I had was that I wish the reservation confirmation informed you that if requesting a shuttle at night that you should text a number for pickup. After about 15 min of calling I finally went to the website and located the number to text. Other than that everything else was just fine. I would use again in the future,Negative

Only on the day before the flight i got an email(no call whatsoever), that they couldnt execute. When i called again, they told me i was too late, because it was already within the 24 hours. Yet another agency unfortunately which has poor customer service and doesnt care about its customers.

Even when i tell ""customer service""  that i can and have used a search engines to check and verify  that there are tickets available(same airline company as original ticket)with seats ready for booking i still get a reply back that it was not possible due to no free tickets available, so due to their incompetence ill have to pay for another ticket It is clearly that they dont care about customers who have to rebook, since they already have revived the payment the 1 star is not even deserved, but cannot give 0",Negative

We've had no responses to emails for weeks and no returns of our calls (back when their phone lines were still active!) either.

So I am out the cost of the part I ordered, and I don’t have the correct part, and they want to charge me $50 restocking and shipping costs. So basically I will have to pay twice if I want them to TRY TO GET ME the part I ordered all due to their mistake in sending the incorrect part.

Contact me before sending back MY money so I could tell them where to send it or 2. Send a secure check by mail that requires a signature.

I contacted Justfly to cancel the flights after pandemic announcement from WHO. The company charged $25 cancellation fee just to cancel the flight and hold the flight credit until Jan. 2021 with conditions, i.e it has to be from original flight company and original destination. This condition for me to use the ticket credit is difficult. I am not Canada citizen and hardly visit Canada. The travel condition is also difficult plus the travel condition to enter Canada boarder- non citizen can not enter the country. I don't think there is a chance for me to travel Canada with in the following 3 years. The company's decision regards to the trouble cause by Covid 19 is without sympathy and has been difficult. They didn't consider customer's individual case and safety.

Half of our crew are over 70 and London requires 14 day quarantine upon arrival. We will be there for 10 days. The airline and justfly has stolen our money or forcing us to travel during a pandemic wanting our members to risk our lives. We requested our money back or a one year voucher and both requests were denied. The first agent we spoke to told us a supervisor will call us back and no one returned a call. The next day a second agent told us they have no supervisors. Very sketchy company and I do not recommend these amateurs to my worst enemy.

They pay people to do 5 star reviews for them and if you look at every single 5 star review, it says ""invited"" for their review, meaning that they are internal reviews that are being mass produced to try and prop their score up. For anyone that is ever thinking about using this company for travel, don't. They are an actual fraud company based out of India, not in California like the website says. They blatantly lie, give a bait and switch tactic to make you buy, then lie more and promise something on the phone, and never deliver the service. This company is all about deceit to try and get your money and not give you a service. They flat-out just steal people's money, especially during this time of all the flights being cancelled and then pretend it's the airlines fault and that they can't do anything to refund you and lie more. I booked a flight a while ago with them and I had the same issue as everyone else where they said they would refund me, kept making up more and more lies every time I called and luckily I documented all emails and calls to catch them in their lie. It took over 6 months of pestering them to get my refund back and took me filing a claim on the BBB and also attorney general's office. This company needs have a massive lawsuit against them, and there is a petition out right now on ""change.org"" Just type in explore trip and you'll see the complaint. If you've been wrong by this company, let's bring them to justice and get these clowns shut down for stealing money and get our money back.",Negative

They will take your money and refuse to refund or offer less than what is owed. After the window for refund is up, you will be told that it has been delayed again or that the airline has not given them the refund. Department of Transportation regulations (which is the law) states ""if a passenger is owed a refund, an airline, travel agent, or online travel agency must process it within seven business days if the passenger paid by credit card, and 20 business days if the passenger paid by cash or check."" Can be found by google searching: ""aviation consumer protection refunds"" For my specific situation I have confirmed with the airline that exploretrip HAS in fact been refunded the money for the flight. Yet, despite the fact that they received the money, I have not been refunded. This has been escalated to their supervisors and still no solution. I have all the conversations recorded too - even the ones where they are screaming at me. Reaching out to escalations@exploretrip .com has not helped at all. the last supervisor said the money would be in my account in three days - that was two weeks ago. I would gladly update this review if they corrected my issue promptly - but I highly doubt they will. Additional resources which I highly recommend everyone uses. File a complaint with the department of transportation. Can be found by google searching: ""airconsumer department of transportation complaint"" Send them a certified letter containing the US Department of Transportation's Enforcement Notice.

I tried to call the agency many times, the wait time was hours long, so I started emailing my request. Their customer service ( no service) doesn’t really read your request, I think they just copy and paste standard robotic replies that don’t make any sense. So after dealing with them and getting nowhere I have decided to submit a dispute through my credit card. Hoping to collect my money. This company got their license to steal and cheat and they get away with it. They lied to me from the beginning regarding a luggage fee for an international flight. Immediately after purchasing my ticket their representative called me asking to pay for my check in luggage $75 each way. I told him that I have never paid for a one check in luggage flying internationally and if that is a new thing I will pay at the airport.  His response to me was that  I will have to pay $150 at the airport. I new something was not right and I called the airline directly. You are going to love this, I was allowed to check in 2 pieces of luggage at NO CHARGE. I hope a lot of people read these reviews and spread the word. I tell everyone not to use them.

3193,"I booked my first international flight with Exploretrip in October 2019 for April 2020 to visit a friend in New Zealand. As my departure date approached, NZ closed their borders. I called Exploretrip to cancel and was robotically told time and time again that I wasn’t allowed a refund, although their website stated that Qantas flights were eligible for a full refund. I followed up with Qantas Agency Connect myself and was guided to the portion of their website that clearly explained where Exploretrip could find the code to request a full refund; quite literally doing all the footwork myself. It was only at that point when I’d done all the work, after being denied a full refund and only offered a flight credit or nearly half of what I paid for my fare, that I was appeased with the promise of a refund in 20-30 days. That was over 75 days ago and I’m still waiting on my refund while my friend in NZ that booked directly with Qantas has had hers for weeks. Do yourself a favor and avoid the verbal abuse, gaslighting, roadblocking, and misinformation that Exploretrip customer service offers and book directly with the airline. UPDATE: I filed a complaint with my state’s consumer protection division and was issued a full refund in about two weeks. I highly suggest you do the same if you’ve been given the runaround like I was.",Negative

When we called, we realized one of the trips was actually already cancelled, and one of the trips was re-scheduled two hours earlier (no notification). Had we not called to check on our flights, we would not have known about the schedule change. Because the first flight was changed to two hours earlier, we would likely have missed the flight, and found out that our returning flight was cancelled altogether. We asked why ExploreTrip did not inform us that one flight was cancelled and one flight was changed to an earlier time. They said it is because they are short staffed. ExploreTrip told us that we would have to pay 400 dollars in ""taxes"". All while the actual airline itself offers full refunds for any cancelled flights, and full credit for any rescheduled flights due to Covid. Book with the airlines, you will talk to people who are not there to scrape fees. The airline was able to provide credit. ExploreTrip was going to eat up all of the money that we already paid, and ask for 400 more. Each ExploreTrip gave different explanations of why they have to add different fees and gave inconsistent explanations about how far they could reschedule out in the future.

3195,"This is the worst experience I’ve ever had with any travel agency, airline....anything, really. I bought an airline ticket through ExploreTrip, and discovered during the COVID19 pandemic that the airline had liquidated. I was never notified that the airline no longer existed or that my flight wasn’t scheduled anymore, rather ExploreTrip only relayed this information to me when I called to cancel my trip. That, by itself, is unacceptable. But things got worse. When I contacted ExploreTrip to receive a refund for the flight that no longer existed, I received the following email: Dear Customer, I hope this email finds you well. We would like to inform you that as per the airlines, unfortunately, a refund cannot be processed. We tried from our end to get a refund, however, as a travel agency, we ought to abide by the airline policies. We apologize for the inconvenience caused to you. Sincerely, April Exploretrip Escalations This response is completely unacceptable. If an airline is unwilling to step up and value its customers, then the travel agency should. “Ought to abide by the airlines policy” is a cop out, and a poor excuse for not helping out customers in this time of need—especially when every known agency is doing so. Credit cards and banks are only issuing chargebacks if they are approved by the company, in this case, ExploreTrip. And they refuse to do so. Exploretrip being a greedy, scammy entity that doesn’t value its customers is an unfortunate, and expensive lesson that I had to learn. But you don’t have to learn that way.

Interjet said all I need to do is contact ExploreTrip and Exploretrip just needs to call Interjet and they will happily work with them to process the refund. However it appears that Exploretrip is very reluctant to do so because whenever they say they will they put me on hold for an hour and then hang up. This is gone on three times already.

Seems excessive for me for both parties to be impacted by the pandemic.  According to the ExploreTrip representative, if I didn't take that offer, I would be in the hole for $336 for a flight from Phoenix to Vancouver, BC.",Negative

It is very clear that the US Dept of Transportation states that if the flight is cancelled by airline, passenger is entitled to a full refund REGARDLESS of the reason. Explore Trip will have to refund the FULL amount and have lost a client for life. Furthermore, I will apply a negative rating and review anywhere I can online and tell everyone I know on what kind of company it is.

3203,"I wish I had never purchased with this company.  In January,we ordered 6 tickets to Budapest at a cost of $5035.38.  In March, I found out the flights were cancelled by checking American Airlines.  I started calling Skybooker every day for 2-3 weeks and sent an email.  Finally on 4-9-20 I filed a dispute with my credit card co.  In June the cc company advising me of ""confirmation showing no cancellation per policy was received""  I called Skybooker again and spoke with Max.  He said I could either get a voucher for the full amount or a refund of $4186 and emailed me to confirm that amount. In light of the poor customer service, I chose the refund.  Then he said they needed a letter from the cc company that ""dispute had been resolved"".  Don't do this.  Once I sent that to them, I received a credit of $3500, leaving me out of $1538.38 for tickets I never cancelled and they never attempted to contact me or rebook.  I called and emailed Severin in their office several times.  They would put me on hold and then hang up on me.  Finally some guy, Max I believe again, actually laughed and said the reason for the smaller credit was because I had filed a dispute with the cc company, even though they knew that in April and in June when we discussed the credit.  They just pulled the $3500 figure out of thin air with no explanation.  I have filed a complaint with the Georgia AG office, BBB and my credit card co again although as Skybooker knows, you can't refile a dispute once it's closed.  They are a scam company and I wish I had read the reviews before I handed over my hard earned money.  I expect them to be out of business within a year at this rate. Update to response:  Nope, that is a lie.  American Airlines advised they issued a full refund with no penalty.  You promised one refund and then gave $686 less for no reason.  Other 3rd party travel agents seem to still be providing customer service.  Why should I have to pay $1538.38 to keep you afloat during the pandemic.  All you had to do was provide the refund that you promised in writing instead of creating this ill will and more horrendous customer reviews.",Negative

Response to emails within a day too so that’s really nice and saves me from calling to busy service numbers.

When I asked what that insulting amount was about they said it was a place holder for the real refund. They have done nothing but lie since then. Saying the airline has not released my refund yet and they are waiting for that. Funny thing is I can call the airline too and they have said numerous times that they have released the booking and nothing is stopping Skybooker from refunding me. They are hoping I will just go away. Criminals. Liars. Thieves. Update This is hilarious. Nice try on your attempt to shame me for calling you the crooks that you are. I paid for a service. You did not deliver on that service I’m owed money back. Imagine you order a pizza and only half is delivered. You would want your money back for the half that wasn’t given to you right?

They never sent any email confirmation, and no credit appeared in Delta system. After multiple calls I finally got email confirmation from Skybooker --  only to find the found the 90% credit isn't an e-Credit like customers who purchased directly from Delta got. This credit is valid towards just a single flight, and any remaining balance forfeited. So no opportunity to gradually use the credit up on shorter domestic flights.

I applied for monetary refunds and after thousand messages and mails via all possible social networks I finally received two vouchers which price was less than I originally paid and in different currencies (one in RUB and one in USD). The vouchers I would hardly or never be able to use due to the travel restrictions and also because the carrier does not fly my routes (the cancelled flights was accidental business trip). Customer service probably consists of low-paid careless Indians whose work is to send copy-paste apologizing and ""be patient"" messages and so the service is low-quality. You should always start from the beginning (reservation, name, email and so on) as your questions and mails always go to a different person. So if you do not keep on asking and insisting what is yours you will probably never be refunded. I am highly astonished of their incompetence and lack of professionalism.

3260,"I am wondering how are they doing business still now even after a lot of negative reviews.KIWI.com is a scam and everyone should be aware of it before running after cheap tickets. There are a lot of hidden charges which are n't pre-informed by Kiwi.com and end up in a difficult situation in the last hour flight. Recently I had to stop myself from flying due to lack of proper information and hidden charges by Kiwi.com.I am pretty sure Kiwi.com is there to trick and cheat people by collecting ticket fees. I tried to get in touch with them to get my refund back but they are not even replying to my single email. On top of that, they don't have a proper address in their website to contact. Therefore, I request everyone not to buy a ticket from KIWI.COM because they do fraud business. Once again think ten times before buying ticket from KIWI.COM.",Negative

3301,"If you want to ask to remove the review, how about try to solve and face your company problem firstly? I've traveling the world so much, almost every month I'm on plane or train, I've never encountered a worse air company like this one! Firstly I was sure I made the booking for May 18, but then when I got the ticket, it said June 18. Then of course I wrote immediately to the customer service that ""it's wrong, please try to make change"". They did not want to, of course. I was sure I had the right to change the ticket within 24 hours after booking; however, they sent me an unbelievable high charge for the ""difference of the ticket"", while I checked the official airline website for the ticket, I found they're lying, I shouldn't pay anything for changing that flight, the difference was 0, but they insisted they're not. Then they delayed to response, to make sure that I passed 24 hours, then I had passed the ""grace period"" to make booking change without additional charge. Everything's on their hands, they will not refund, and they will not to admit their misbehave! One of the biggest lies in the Air company history, I believe!",Postive

I called them when it was apparent the flight to Paris was going to be late, they told me to call them back when I arrived in Paris. When I arrived there I was too late for my flight to Glasgow. I could not get through to Flyhacks and as it was late I booked both a flight the next morning and accommodation myself. Upon claiming I was first told they would refund me the flight but only partial refund for accommodation. I accepted this to get it moving. Now, a month and a half later, I am still chasing them. Latest was that they would not refund anything as they claim I did not get in touch with them. For fun, check my initial review on the 15th and their response. So even though they in public state that they will refund me, now they will not.",Postive
3306,"I wanted to give this review a more positive note because of the ordeal that I went through (and I'm sure many people have during this pandemic) but after all that has happened I can't. My experience was related to a March cancelled return flight for which I requested a refund. I know some people might still be waiting for these but mine finally arrived after 3 months or jumping through hoops and painful phone calls as well as working to find out where the refund was coming from (flight was actually operated by Level). But it seemed like it was going to happen, I received a positive email with the exact correct sum I was going to receive and lo and behold when I gazed at my bank account to see the refunded sum was actually lower than what I was expecting. Really, was it really necessary to do this? I'm not going to contest this now, it's just beneath me. It just amazes me how even at he last minute this company tried to financially save it's a** at the expense of the customer. Hope it was worth it Vueling.

3315,"Our flight was cancelled on our way to the airport in France to return to the UK.  Poor communication from Vueling and no help offered at the airport.  We were able to get a Eurostar train home instead.  This was mid-March and we are now the end of June and Vueling have still not refunded our money.  To get hold of them on the phone was nearly impossible - on hold for 45mins to be cut off and then and for 40mins and finally got through to someone who gave me an email address to contact.  Their email replies are slow but they do come back to me - they kept pushing the wait time for the refund back from 6 weeks, to 8 weeks then 12 weeks.  Finally they said the refund was to be processed ""next week"" but that was nearly 3 weeks ago and still no money has been returned.",Negative
3316,"Very satisfied and surprised with the way they handled my cancelled flight due to Corona. 3,5 weeks before my flight, they emailed me informing me about the cancellation and giving me the option to request a refund voucher, which I did. Only 11 days later, the refund voucher with clear instructions landed in my inbox. Knowing that times are incredibly hard on each airline, I think Vueling is by far the best flight company to handle my cancelled flight with clear communication. Never expected this from a low-cast carrier, while I'm still proactively battling with luxury airlines. Way to go, Vueling!",Postive
3317,"Useless airline, absolutely pathetic on-line procedure that is pointless anyway as you have to line-up and check in your hold baggage at the check-in desk!! Please, do the aviation business a favour and disappear...you are an embarrassment.",Negative

3319,"I write this review hoping to help other people which I saw had the same problem as me. I had a flight canceled due to the outbreak and received an email to tell me I could use the voucher/credit for another flight or if I preferred, I could call a number to ask for a refund. First of all, they don't tell you how to use the credit, I booked through Skyscanner referral and didn't register to Vueling's website so I couldn't log in to check if I really had the credit to use. Second, like many other people I read here in the reviews, it is IMPOSSIBLE to connect to the English speaking customer service (I called from UK +442038685708) because it's just an automated voice (probably they got rid of English call centre). After many trials I decided to try with the Spanish one (same number but I pressed Spanish language) ((thank God I speak Spanish!)) and I finally got to speak with an agent who tried to convince me to keep the credit but I asked for a refund. She told me the refund went through, even though the system showed it was only possible to issue the same amount I had paid in GBP in Euros - therefore I will lose money with this trick. The appalling unprepared woman also told me that since the sale appeared as intermediated through Skyscanner I would have to ask Skyscanner for my money. (After I contacted them, I realised they don't take money, it's just a referral so hopefully I will have my money back on my account!) Now to the part that I hope will help other people: BEWARE! if you try to contact the support through the online form on the website you can only ask for COMPENSATION even if you are enquiring about a REFUND. This for me was a bad mistake because I received multiple emails referring to this request saying that by EU Regulation 261/2004 I am not entitled to compensation because the cancellation was due to ""extraordinary circumstances"" (The coronavirus pandemic is being classed as an extraordinary circumstance and therefore you will not qualify for the compensation. Nonetheless, you are still entitled to your money back in full and not a voucher or rebooking.) Summary: everyone has the RIGHT to claim money back for their cancelled flights if they do not wish to use the credit for another flight. The only way to do it with Vueling is through Spanish speaking customer service, which is really bad, this is why I put 1 star only. If you clicked on ask for compensation they will tell you no no no, even if you are simply asking to confirm that the refund was issued. Shame on you Vueling! What a shambles!",Negative
3320,"Same experiences as many on here. Applied for a refund for cancelled flight, promised one but nothing forthcoming. Tried the various phone number but got the loop. E-mailed the management team and the CEO -nothing. E-mailed Willie Walsh CEO of parent company IAG but not the courtesy of a reply. Awaiting refund through credit card but expecting this to be defended by Vueling so next step is a CCJ and hopefully see them on ""Can't pay they'll take it away"".",Negative
3321,"Vueling refused to refund the money I paid them for four flights because of Covid 19. First, they said they would process my request for a refund, and then they declined me a refund. We pay in advance in good faith so this is entirely unacceptable.",Negative
3322,"Flight was cancelled due to COVID, which is fine and not in their control, but their dealings since have been awful. Applied for a refund, they tried to palm me off with a flight voucher. After stating I wanted a cash refund, as I was entitled to, they sent an email with a phone number to call. The phone number is just a loop of automation and pressing buttons, that ends in ""Press 1 to hear the message again, press 2 to end the call"". Called their other complains number and the guy told me that he would report it as an ""IT issue"" but couldn't help, put me through to finance or give an alternative number. I issued a chargeback with AMEX - guess what, they replied to AMEX so that was reversed. I'm now trying to recover the money through Resolver, and then will take it to court if needed. The ticket was only £65, but I'd much rather spend the time getting it back than let them have a penny.",Negative
3323,I would never fly with Vueling again! Avoid at all costs. I was delayed for 2 days and had to pay for things I was promised I would get refunded on. All I got was automated emails denying any responsibility. Honestly the worst airline I have ever dealt with.,Negative
3324,"We have the same problem. We got an email about our cancelled flights and how to get a refund. But you have to ring them. All you get is an answering machine. When I finally was put through to an agent and he only spoke spanish, even though I rang both the UK number and the number for all other countries. E-mail as others have experienced is a no-reply e-mail, so that does not work either. We are a group of 5 and none of us will ever use this bad company again.",Negative
3325,"I would give no stars if I could. My flight was cancelled due to Covid-19 and I was offered either a refund or a credit. I accepted a credit which they said I would get in 10 days. I obviously understand the huge delay which was completely fine under the circumstances (I work in travel myself) However I did not get a reply until almost 3 months later when they told me they have looked at my case and I will now receive nothing. This is completely unacceptable and also against the law. As I was not asking for a cash refund it should not have been a problem for them to reimburse me with a credit note.  Customers need to be escalate these issues to the CAA. Airlines should not be able to treat their customers like this, especially in these unsettling and scary times. Disgusting.",Negative
3326,"I had a flight booked with Vueling from Valenica Spain to Amsterdam on 5 Aug 2020. I live in Australian and they have put a ban on overseas travel during the pandemic. Vueling has done nothing to change their policies during this time to assist their customers. They suggested I change my flight, I do not live in Europe, I can't just ""change"" my flight, I live on the other side of the world. Europe was part of our 5 month world trip starting 1st Aug. We have 21 flights to cancel. All other airlines are issuing refunds during this time. Disgraceful company, do no book with them, they do not care about their customers. Spend the extra $$ and go with someone else",Negative
3327,"Bad doesn't describe it, terrible customer service. After arranging a Stag Do in Alicante,  I booked an outgoing flight from Bristol July 10th with Ryanair which has subsequently been cancelled and an incoming flight with Vueling into Cardiff 13th July which hasn't. Their predictable response was no refund because flight is still operational. Unless I individually travel 1500 miles halfway across the continent for a 3 day celebration, common sense says I'm not going to make that flight. I will never book with these incompetents again and advise anyone else to do the same. Customer service is bottom of their priorities and I will do everything in my power to get refunds for myself and several friends who have chosen the same itinerary. What was identified by myself as a great opportunity to celibrate a unique occasion has been tarnished by this""money first"" attitude. ¡ Este no es el final del asunto !",Negative
3328,"Vueling Airlines notified us by emails in March 2020 that our return flights to Mallorca in the first week of April 2020 had been cancelled as a consequence of the Covid-19 outbreak. We immediately logged on to our online account and requested that their full cost be refunded back to the credit card from which they had been deducted. As the only confirmation of this refund request that we possessed was a screenshot, it was decided to telephone Customer Services to ensure that this decision had been accurately recorded. In the course of a conversation with Vueling representative Isa on 29 March she confirmed that our refund application was to be processed but that, because of staff shortages, it might take up to eight weeks. As stipulated eight weeks had passed, felt that our patience had run out, particularly bearing in mind that the airline had a legal obligation to refund us within seven days in accordance with articles 5(1)(a) and 8(1)(a) of EC Regulation No.261/2004, so decided to chase it. Numerous attempts to contact the company by telephone came to naught as, after holding for a while, the automated system cut us off. Further emails sent this week to Customer Services and the company CEO (Javier.Sanchez at vueling.com) have been met, almost laughably, with a standard acknowledgement which asks that we telephone their offices if we wish to request a refund! As previously, attempts to contact this company fail with calls being cut off. Whilst appreciating the problems currently besetting the airline industry the facts in this matter are that monies held by Vueling since we booked in January were legally repayable long ago since this is a clear breach of contract with no flights having been provided.",Negative
3329,"I recommend to avoid booking flights with this airline until they have solved their problems. The Corona-crisis has shown their incompetence to handle and solve issues. If your flights were canceled between March and June 2020, you had two options: Ask for a refund or re-schedule the flight. In case you asked for a refund: They promised you a confirmation-email within 10 days. But nothing was sent to me so far (more than 2 months since my first cancellation). In case you want to chose a flight later in the year: It's limited to 60 days after the initial flight if you want to avoid extra-charges. How can they get away with these illegal practices in Europe?",Negative

(and that's the trick #2 goes, obviously) . i called dozen times from moscow to barcelona , each time ending up the ansewring machine hanging up. no putting on hold, ever. looks like there is no such an option whatsoever. i am really surprised that in europe this sort of business is eligible. thriving, maybe? alas, chaos overwhelming. btw, here in russia , rogue business is an everyday reality, though, you can consider talking to an operator at anytime. e.g. s7 copied the same illicit scheme of "" flight credits "", and had frozen my money as well, though, they dont hide away  from customers. any vueling people here, pls elaborate. i need a solution.",Negative

I have just tried to fill in a form for SPF Mobilite as suggested by someone else here but you cannot complain about a flight in the future, so no flexibility there!

3337,"Dear fellows, The EU has put together a list of national authorities that surveil the applicaiton of passengers'rights in the EU. The Belgian one can be found online as well. Please write to them (as I will also) and do complain against Brussels airlines. I cannot provide you the link to the authority as links are not allowed on this page. Here the name of the authority and you can find them SPF Mobilité & Transport Direction générale Transport aérien Cellule Stratégique - Droits des passagers City Atrium (6èmeétage - locker PAX)  Rue du Progrès 56    BE - 1210 Bruxelle. My experience with Brussels airlines is very bitter and concerns the Covid-19 50 EUR Voucher scam. When you receive the voucher you are told an amount of 50 EUR will be deducted on future purchases. In reality they oblige you to purchase new flights by calling them. When you do that, the indian call-center person communicates to you fake prices which do not exist and are significantly higher than what you would normall pay and what you see on BA's website. This way, your 50 EUR voucher turns into a scam becuase you cannot use it actually. When you ask for reimbursement the indian call-center people just hang-up the phone (after making you wait tens of minutes). I am really disgusted and encourage you to follow me in complaining with the Belgian national authority in charge of EU passenger rights against BA's practice. Another scam (amounting to tax avoidance - criminal activity) lies in the fact that BA refuses to issue you an invoice of the (new) flight you purchased with them when you use the voucher. In this way, BA ensures that you never see that the price the indian back-up persons communicates to you. I specifically explained to the call support that not issuing an invoice for the (new) flight amounts to criminal activity and I will certainly write to the national authority. By not issuing an invoice, you cannot actually prove that a flight costing 80 EUR on the website is being sold to you at e.g. 120 EUR when you use the voucher. Like this you are kept captive with the BA and you are obliged to purchase with them but without the benefit of the announced 50 EUR voucher (in reality a scam). A refund will never happen either. The indian back-up support will refuse to give you any deadline or timeframe. Afterwars they will hang up the phone.",Postive

3342,"Brussels Airlines has turned into a fraudulent hoax. Flight cancelled due to Corona. Overselling rebooking and link to refund is only found when searching hard in email. LINK FOR REFUND NOT WORKING When going through the procedure of refund it doesn't work like so many report not only here but also on other language versions of trustpilot. Booking is simply not accessible. PHONE AND CHAT NEVER ANSWERED They are referring to cancellation via chat, social media or phone. Chat is never answered by agent (tried several times and waited for a very long time on each occasion), phone is never answered (sat on hold at all times for up to 30 minutes, never an answer). SOCIAL MEDIA NOT WORKING FOR REFUND Social media channels auto-replies as soon as you write the word refund in a message. You get a standard answer saying that your request cannot be processed and you are referred back to the initial refund-link that doesn't work. Nowhere are there any email addresses for refund and I also see a ton of people stating that they tried and it doesn't work. Brussels Airlines deserves to be reported to the FOD and someone should also file a police report for fraudulent behaviour. This is not okay no matter the situation! Brussels Airlines are deliberately trying to tire people by having them go through a never ending loop as to avoid facing COVID-19 related refunds. Had issues with other airline companies and online booking portals. But this here with Brussels Airlines simply beats everything. It is really nasty and they should be called out in the media for their disgusting practices. They are by law required to offer refunds when they cancel.",Negative

Since we didn't reply the email in time Brussels airlines just decides to cancel our flight without garanteeing giving any other option. We get this confirmed a couple of days later in another email that our whole flight is made invalid.

3352,"I wanted to leave a review from an experience in March 2020 (EBB-CPH). The conclusion first. I am not too happy with Brussels anymore because of their terrible communication and very understaffed customer service combined with a rather condescending attitude towards customers. My family member's first flight was canceled the day after she bought the ticket and she rebooked to another flight a day earlier. Then the new flight's second leg was canceled but they only told us on arrival at Entebbe Airport a few hours before departure! No option to rebook and no help whatsoever on what to do. Crucially, no information was given about what boarding would result in. Customer service didn't answer the phone (we gave up after an hour) and since getting stuck in Uganda was not an option, boarding was the only possibility. The whole time I tried calling them from Denmark and almost two hours after departure they finally answered the phone. At first, they didn't want to help ""since she had decided to board the plane"" but after explaining that no information was given by their own staff and that they just told us to call customer service (with no answer!) the guy was reasonable and asked the manager if anything could be done. The second part of the trip was then rebooked. If it hadn't been for the coronavirus-situation I would have given just one star but at least the problem was solved. She had to wait for 13 hours in Brussels but she got to the destination eventually. Still, two hours in a telephone queue is never acceptable, especially when the staff on the ground don't want to answer the relevant questions.",Postive

They cancelled the flight before any restrictions on travel had been implemented between UK and Turkey. Are literally holding onto everyone's money and refusing to pay back and refund. Shocking behaviour. Would never use again or recommend - worst customer services ever, providing misinformation and ignoring the facts of the refund claim. An appeal to all that read and have been affected, don't be lured back into travelling or booking any future flights with Pegasus airlines once some normality resumes. Collectively companies have to be held to account for poor customer services, fraud and serving their own self interest.

Facebook messages, E-Mails, messages on their support page, and phone calls all went unanswered for over a month (in spite of the fact that their page says they will respond within 48 hours). The day before my first flight was to have taken place, I decided that I couldn’t wait any longer and just disputed the charge through my bank. They have a sponsored post on Facebook. If you see it, just look at the comments - almost all of them are from people like myself, asking why they’re not responding to support requests. They responded to my critical reply by lying, claiming that they had sent me an email 23 days prior, and to look in my junk folder. I did that and found nothing. I only had the automated responses saying they would respond soon, proof that they actually HAD received my email, but didn’t bother to do anything about it. What’s more, 23 days prior to that message was still over a month after I first contacted them, and well after my first flight was to have taken place.

Unfortunately, we were not allowed to board the flight QR 853 at 02:25 AM on the 24th of June the following day to arrive in Doha and take further connecting flights. Connecting flights are QR 095 and QR 159 from Qatar Airlines. The boarding was denied on basis of not being allowed to travel to the destination according to the flight crew only. Qatar Airways crew have said to us a lot of different versions why we are not allowed to board: we have a luggage and it will disappear in transit zone while other customers were allowed to take the luggage, but we hadn't a luggage, only handbag; we were asking about relatives in Denmark, we do not have one, but do we need? Next version was concerned to internal Qatar Airways policy. We have been shown WizzAir tickets from Copenhagen to Kyiv and proof of the embassy of Ukraine in Denmark as well as official documents on the government pages (all this documents are attached). Also we have been calling official represent of the embassy of Ukraine in Denmark urgently, the Qatar Airways crew have spoken with her too. We have been provided yet any form of cooperation to board or refund the flight had been denied with the exception of being given an email to write to. Also the last reason is next: we are not allowed to board because to buy tickets from Qatar Airways isn't enough. We must have permission of Qatar Airways company but which one anybody do not know. So why are you selling tickets? Also, our friend from Ukraine, had the same flight on 22 of June with the same destination (QR 159). She had boarded successfully. Qatar Airways have said that it is impossible even when we have shown the photo of her boarding pass and only in the end the crew have confirmed it with the words “exceptional case”. Nobody knows which one. Qatar Airways crew have been played the time, haven't been answered any of our questions, just been ignored us and been running from one counter to another. As a result the boarding gate is closed, we were still at the check-in counter and were asking Qatar Airways crew to provide any official document with information why we are not allowed to board. The crew were continue to ignore us and we had to resort to Airport Police just to document that we have been at the airport and have been trying to board (police report is attached). As a result: We lost conjunction flight by WizzAir (номер) we have lost our money by the way. Also there are not so many ways to come back to Ukraine from Malaysia. There are only Qatar Airways flights and Turkish Airlines as well. We had to sleep at the airport without food and even water (you definitely know how airports are functioning now). We have spent money for taxi two times. We had to book new apartment in KL unexpectedly. Who will cover expenses? So as the result we were not allowed to come back to our country in this difficult Covid-19 situation without any official reasons, also crew have said that internal policy of the company is higher than government law.

They basically stranded me and left me to fend for myself without any support. Their solution was to offer a return flight in May, leaving me stranded for 6 weeks. This is a terrible company and without any responsibility for the people they carry. They have shown me that they genuinely do not care at all about any human being, I asked and pleaded with them to help me get back to my family and even then, they didn’t offer a place on a flight back to the UK. Furthermore, they mentioned force majeure and government mandate as to the reason why they cancelled their flight. However, the UK didn’t close its borders, so the flight back had no issues taking off and bringing people back to their homes and families. Pegasus are liars and a terrible company. I implore anyone reading this, avoid Pegasus no matter what and do not take a flight with this company. They are horrible and will leave you stranded as soon as anything gets remotely tough. I bought a separate ticket with Turkish Airlines and flew back that way. Funny how Turkish Airlines could fly back but Pegasus couldn’t… Absolutely dishonest.",Negative

3409,"This is my first time to buy tickets from this company to visit Turkey. Because of CoronaVirus; my ticket and my wife's ticket has been cancelled on the 19th of March, 2020. I have been emailing them for almost 10 days, and their response is system automated, stating that they are under pressure and they will look into my query A.S.A.P., I am sorry, but why on Earth you would not refund all of the tickets? How hard could it be? Don't tell me you have no enough staff to process refunds quickly! ... I remember back in the days in 2009 I was supposed to attend Michael Jackson's last concert in London, but he died before the concert happens. There were 50,000 tickets sold for one venue, and they were all cancelled and refunded within 24 hours. Don't tell me you do not have a system that can refund a few hundreds or thousands of your customers in bulk with a switch of a button! ... You are lying about your excuse of shortage of staff, and you want to hold the money past the flight date so that you would deduct some of the refunds for missing flight cancellation fees! You are a skunk and a skum!  ... What confirms my thought is that I phone called Pegasus today and I was told to wait at least for one month after the flight's date to receive a refund. WHY? In a time of crises like this; people are in a much need for the money, and you are holding the money for too long without a reason? WHY AGAIN? Is this your way to respond to the situation of the CoronaVirus by making people struggle instead of helping them? What a horrible thing to do! ... You have bad ethics and you deserve all penalties and punishments that you'll receive from World air aviation authority very soon, for treating your customers so badly. I have filed a chargeback against your institute today. I demand a full refund NOW or I promise I'll tell the whole world about it, and I'll never remove my feedback and rating on Trustpilot until you stand up for yourself and refund me immediately!

3410,"Booked a flight to India via Sky-tours,  However, with the Covid-19 situation, all flights to India had to be cancelled.  We are being given the run-around for the refund.  Been in contact with Elizabeth from sky-tour who talks about a credit voucher which hasn't been issued.   We would like to know why we are not given a cash refund or even a physical credit voucher.  On your website you state that 'Sky-tours offers an instant refund via a credit voucher, even when the airline will take months to refund! The Sky-tours voucher is NOT subject to any specific airline or passenger! Meaning it can be used by anyone you decide, with any airline, any route and at any time* for the full amount of your cancelled flights'   stated by  Elizabeth on the Sky-tour FAQ site. YET  - when we contact her, she sends an email without a voucher but a link to  re-book another flight with the flight booking code.  When we contacted Qatar Airlines, we found that sky-tours gave them incomplete information for our booking thus making it difficult for them to help us.  We want a physical voucher and more importantly a cash refund!  With  this situation, we are not sure when we will be travel again.  The flights HAD to be cancelled by the Airlines and thus they would have given a full refund to the travel agent. IT is really frustrating since there is no way to talk to anyone from Sky-tours.

3411,"I flew from Russia to the UK back in November 2019. The flight was delayed 3hrs so I contacted them to ask about the connection. They told me that the delay would not affect my arrival time into Istanbul! Errm, ok! A 3hr delay to a 3hr flight won't affect the arrival time. In total I was delayed 13hrs. When I reached the UK I tried claiming the delay compensation. They told me the delay was due to extreme weather in Russia. Other planes were landing and taking off. Also I was in Russia staring longingly at the runway for my plane and trust me, there was no extreme weather. I highlighted this with weather reports as evidence. They claimed that they had a different 'superior' weather report which said different. After months of TA denying any wrongdoing, I got a claims management company involved. Instantly the Turkish aviation authorities ruled in my favour. However getting the compensation from them has been like pulling teeth. Several times they've made laws up and even pointed to their own policy which they've blatantly not followed, but claim they have. The conversation goes around in circles. They also say that there has been no wrongdoing whatsoever on Turkish Airlines' side... as if some third party made their staff lie. As someone who travels to the Middle East 5-6 times a year, I am never flying Turkish Airlines again. I'd rather transit via Pyongyang than ever have to sit on a Turkish Airlines plane ever again.

Having booked flights for September with a 3rd party agent, panic set in when I realised one of my four flights had been cancelled without my knowledge and no alternative provided. No response from the agent despite multiple messages, and judging by their reviews, they've gone a bit AWOL. I decided to try my luck by contacting Turkish Airlines directly (despite them being within their right to say I must deal with the 3rd party agent), and they couldn't have been more helpful. They have swapped me onto a new flight without a fuss and I can now see it when I login to the Turkish Airlines website and also on the 3rd party agent's website. I'm thrilled and this has really put my mind at ease.",Postive

3415,"I’ve spent around 100 euros to call their international helpline to get support since the local Estonian office is closed and they don’t answer the phone calls. Since I was not able to change my flight destination after it was cancelled on their website as it was saying to contact them by phone to change it. I have called them 9 times and wasted my money to ask them to change the destination of my trip which was cancelled by them. For no explainable reason, they were not changing the destination of my flight. I called them 9 times and every agent was telling completely different things about the same questions. They were completely not aware of the their own company policies or they were just skipping my requests by not providing any sort of assistance. During one of the calls, one agent just cancelled the phone call in the middle of a conversation, first I thought it was maybe a technical mistake but after waiting for half an hour of not getting a callback, I understood that they are all just skipping and ignoring my questions and requests. After calling for several times one agent promised me that he will change it in an hour and asked me to call back after an hour, and when I called them back after ONE AND A HALF hour again they had no information about my request, so that agent who promised that will change it just lied to me to skip my request. So on my 9th call to their support line was kind of success as the agent finally changed my flight in just 10 mins. So I wasted 100 euros just for calling to change my flight which could be done in just 10 min as the last agent did so. This is ridiculous. I have no word to describe how disappointing experience I had with Turkish Airline's helpline agents.",Negative

They refuse to  listen to customer issues or complaints; asking you to fill in an online form which only generates generic responses. Their “customer relations” provide no additional support beyond the information on your ticket, and are actually the rudest team I’ve ever had to deal with. One disturbing pattern I’ve noticed, is that when they struggle to understand English or address your query, they simply put the phone on mute. This trend has happened at least 8 times, across various phones. Do yourself a favour and look at low-cost alternatives or other national carriers. Nothing goes right with Turkish Airlines, and there’s no one to talk to in these cases.",Negative
3420,"The worst airlines ever It was my worst experience of dealing with an airline without a doubt. They sold me a ticket for May 4th at April 9th. It was cancelled on April 17th. I asked for a refund and I was told that the money will be available in my bank account 60 days after the flight ban is resumed. However according to EC261 which is applicable to all the flights departing EU cities, even for non-EU carrier, the refund must be paid in less than two weeks even in the case of Covid-19. Then, they opened flights on their website for May 27th. As I had not received my refund (And still I have not received that !!!), I asked them to give me a ticket on the flight at May 27th instead of refund, they said no. I paid again and the flight was cancelled again, then I rebooked for June 1st cancelled again and finally June 10th and another cancellation. I bought the flight for May 27th on May 14th. It is interesting that according to TRT news they would have fly to several countries in June which does not include Iran or Ireland. This news was written on May 6th a week before I bought my second ticket. So, according to my opinion THEY KNEW IN ADVANCE THAT THE FLIGHT WILL BE CANCELLED, still they sold me a ticket. According to my opinion, they are selling tickets to get money for the flights that are not supposed to happen. And now I am in hard time getting my money back as they are telling me they would give back my money 60 days after restrictions are lifted. They say that would be August 10th which would be four months. DO NOT BUY A TICKET FROM THIS AIRLINE AT ANY COST. If your flight gets cancelled, which seems to be very common these days, they will not refund you for a long time. I have been waiting since April This review is my personal opinion",Negative

This is extremely corrupt and inappropriate behaviour, and there's a huge risk you'll be trapped by Turkish Airlines. They refused to call and check with the embassy or destination country, even though the embassy gave me their contact number and e-mail for them, they said it didn't matter, because they didn't allow me to enter because of their own policies.

I contacted Expedia customer services as they are the company I paid my money to, luckily getting through to an agent, as the pre recorded message states that they are only dealing with customers with flights that are due in 72 hours. I spoke to a lady called Aisha and was advised that they can not do anything to adjust the flight or refund me immediately as they require approval from Thai Airlines as their policy may require me to pay a cancellation fee. This would then mean I would lose money for my hotel, transfers and holiday days should the flight proceed with the changed dates by Thai Airways. If Thai Airways were decent they would just allow their customers a full refund without cancellation fees as they are the ones responsible for the customer wanting to cancel due to them changing their customers flights. To add further insult, the customer Service lady Aisha at Expedia said that she has had to contact Thai Airways to 'see what they could do' and I would have to wait 7-10 days for a response from Thai Airways before I would even find out if I can get a refund with a cancellation fee as Thai Airways wouldn't answer her call. I have attempted to call Thai Airways myself and they phone just rings and rings with no answer ever, this has to be the worst airline I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with, please avoid at all costs!",Negative

Reply to emails - sent emails to various Thai Airways email addresses over the last week, since Boris Johnson advised against all but essential travel. However, not one has been replied. The UK Government has said not to travel, yet Thai Airways don’t deem that sufficient to issue refunds. Their website says about offering vouchers for travel before a certain date but whose to say that this whole Covid-19 issue will be resolved by then? Come on Thai Airways. Do the right thing and issue refunds to those who want them, vouchers to those who want them and amendments to those who want them.",Negative

3473,"So we had no choice in using Thai Airways when we booked our package tour in Vietnam!  However, we had never flown with them so were quite excited to see what it would be like.  We were so disappointed.  The flight from Heathrow to Bangkok was awful.  The leg room is one of the worst I've experienced and even though they advertise the fact that their recline is one of the best it meant that the person in front of me was basically lying on me to the point I had to climb over the arm of my chair to be able to get in and out of my seat.  We both have very long legs and both passengers in front of us decided to use the maximum recline element and so we couldn't move, 10 hours cramped flying is not our idea of fun!  I understand that we all have the option to recline but to that degree is ridiculous and it's not something I would do, but then I always think of others, other people don't!  We did try to pay for the extra leg room seats which were available but they only accepted credit card payments not debit card.  I have never had my debit card turned down as payment before on any other airways.  We don't own a credit card and don't ever want to have one! Payment is payment as far as I'm concerned!  So the beginning to my wonderful adventure was ruined (10 hours of hell).  Our flight back from Bangkok to Heathrow was just as bad but in different ways.  We paid for extra leg room, they accept debit card payments online, so that was great.  However, the staff were very unprofessional and very under trained.  One sat there through take off not even doing up his seat belt!  They had no control over the trollies the amount of times they knocked into my partners chair was ridiculous and also dropped a whole tray on him!  They got the times of the meals wrong, they brought out a dinner which should have been breakfast, so instead they just brought out the breakfast straight after.  The food was some of the worst I've had on a flight and they really need to inform you if a meal is spicy hot and not just leave it as a surprise!  We will never, out of choice, fly with Thai airlines again!",Negative

This was my first all-inclusive. I heard wonderful thing about these trips...I got the complete opposite. I went by the recommendation from Vacation Express Website... The room was dirty,no stocked drinks or room service. Had no running water in the room at one point in the trip, toilet would not flush unless you took the top off the water basin and manually pulled the chain. You only got (3) bottles of water a day to your room,this was for drinking and brushing your teeth.The food was lousy and the drinks where worse. Actually lost 5 pounds. The safe in the room malfunctioned, called front desk a few times-waited for security for 2 hour to come at bedtime so I could take my meds. All the issues didn't happen all at once, but we reported a different issue daily to the staff who was very little help and rude. Also always asking for drinking water... I recall having to walk to the front desk more than once -just for the bottle drinking water. After this horrible experience, I contacted Vacation Express. I wanted them to know and wanted a refund. After being told they had no record of any issues, even though we went to or called the front desk daily about these issue.Vacation Express said they could do nothing. After about a dozen emails going back and forth, Vacation Express refunded my girlfriend and I $500 total- We paid $3200. Oh... they gave us a $150 dollar voucher, that you can not combine with any other offers. That include their $100 discount that they give anyone. Truly a bad trip from beginning to end.

Over 5 weeks later, still nothing. Tried reaching out a few times over social media as it’s the most likely to get a response, however the response is always the same, a copy/paste of ‘we seek your understanding blah blah difficult times blah working through refunds in order of departure’. I seek YOUR understanding that flight only cancellations bought by credit card are supposed to be refunded within 7 days! Not 5+ weeks and still counting, and that your delay means I pay interest on the cancelled flights! They told me two weeks ago that they’re working through mid March departures. If now two weeks later they’re still not at the end of March for our refund then I feel sorry for anyone who is departing later. I will update this review if/when the refund has been processed so people can get a real idea of the time it is actually taking.

I had to wait over one month for Delta to locate my bag, despite the automated voice message and all representatives that I spoke to, telling me that my bag was safe and would be delivered the following day. They lost my bag over the entire Christmas period, It contained all my presents and clothes that had packed for my family reunion. The fact that I was lied too about having my bag delivered the following day, every day, meant that I was reluctant to replace the contents of my bag. Delta representatives told me over the phone that I would not be charged for the phone calls I made to their helpline. This was a lie. When I challenged them and asked to be reimbursed for the bill that was over 500 euro, I was told, ""it's not our policy to reimburse phone calls""... It obviously is within their policy to lie to customers, lose their luggage, and ruin their Christmas holiday. Do not fly with Delta. Fly with anybody else!",Postive

The customer service representative consulted with a supervisor and agreed to give me a full refund without penalties as this was a COVID-19 related situation.    As of 4/28/20 I have not received a refund.  After spending much time in a call queue, a representative informed me that a refund would not be coming and I would only receive a voucher with time limitations, despite being told that I would receive a full refund in March.   I was then transferred to another customer service representative who would only repeat the same lines over and over again.  The representative refused to provide me with a transcript of my previous call, refused to transfer me to another person to provide assistance, and was incredibly rude and condescending.  He would not send me anything in writing, stating a policy that he couldn’t provide me with either.  The representative acknowledged that I was told to expect a refund and then told me that I would never get a refund and that no one in Delta could help me.  He then hung up on me after I again asked to speak with someone who could help me. Delta is refusing to honor a refund that was already promised by a Delta employee who was authorized to promise a refund. Delta's customer service is extremely offensive.   It is very clear that their only role is to stonewall customers in hopes that they give up and go away.   I will continue to lobby for my refund because a: it was promised to me and b: I will NEVER willingly fly with Delta  again and so a voucher is useless to me.",Negative

I keep on trying to get in touch with Ava and now they send another email saying that we don’t reply to their emails that’s why they closed our case.

Under section 17 of the Malaysian Consumer Protection Act 1999, no refund policies for future contracts are illegal.

3518,15th March I was meant to fly back to Sydney from Amsterdam. I was visiting family and friends and with COVID-19 I found it hard to leave. I was checked in but later that day read on the Singapore website that you weren't allowed to enter Singapore airport if you've been to Germany in the last 14 days. I did. I went through Germany for wintersport to Austria just before. I was scared to board my flight cause I didn't know what could happen if I would show up at the airport and told them I was in Germany. I also didn't want to take the risk of contaminating others since I didn't know if I was a carrier or not of the disease. I had the privilege to stay longer and be with my family so I cancelled my flight. I received 83 euros back (which hardly covers my flight) and I didn't have a choice of accepting that money or not.  I just got it back. I tried to contact the airline many times about the situation and never got a reply. Now they're finally replying and saying they can't help me because I already received 83 euro back for my cancellation. Whereas I know and should've had the right to receive flight credits instead for a flight back to Sydney. Obviously 83 euro won't cover that. I think this is ridiculous since I saved them the effort and risk of me coming to the airport and myself for having to drive there and go through all these complications. I'm appalled and wouldn't recommend anyone to fly with them if they treat people like this during these hard times.,Negative

There're several layers of unacceptable mistakes: 1. while booking, passengers are not informed of possible travel bans 2. after booking, Singapore airline does not send notification messages to remind passengers of the travel ban in action 3. right at the airport at the gate, Singapore airline just BLOCK the entire boarding area and secretly let allowed passengers to board - without informing all the other non-Singaporean passengers, and let us all wait until the plane takes off. The most ridiculous part is, we even approach the ground staff asking when we are allowed to board, and the staff simply asked us to wait. After the scheduled take-off time the staff just left the boarding gate and left all the remaining passengers wait for nothing, without a single announcement or apology.

3535,"Neither ticket or refund. I came from Germany on March 11. On March 26 I had a return flight, operated by Aer Lingus,  which was canceled. The agency Travelstart, where I bought my ticket, didn't  refund me for the canceled flight. So, I lost my money.  Then I decided to buy a new ticket by Delta Airlines. I have to fly to Germany (Dusseldorf). My son tried to pay via PayPal , but he couldn't finish payment because of system failure on the Delta's website. He clicked 2 times to finish transaction. But both attempts were thriveless. We didn't receive neither any payment confirmation from PayPal or the ticket from Delta, although the money in double charge left PayPal account ( we see that the payment is still pending).  We called many times Delta and PayPal. But no one helped us. Every time we have to tell the same story to the new person on telephone.  I urgently need to go back to Germany.

My parents were supposed to fly back on March 21 from PHX to DEL but the unfortunate COVID19 situation led to a string of cancellations. However, at a time when organizations are putting in extra effort to support customers, it looks like Delta isn't ready to compromise at all. The earliest my parents (senior citizens) are able to fly back home based on current regulations is on May 4 and while Delta cancelled our flights, the only options that were presented to us were either a 11 hour layover at London or get the next available flight in June! They are not even willing to book them on other flights being run by other airlines plainly due to ""company policies"" when they self contradicted themselves and gave us an American flight previously.

3543,628.40 not refunded. A physician conference was cancelled due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The supervisor on the phone proceeded to tell me that the outbreak was ‘not a huge problem’ and the world was ‘not shutting down.’ So take the ‘e-ticket’. I don’t want the e-ticket. I want my money back. Last time I checked a supervisor for an airline did not have a medical degree. She continued to refer to the fact that it was still ‘safe to fly.’ Because she also has a degree in aviation and airplane air exchange. The fact of the matter is....the conference cancelled. The hotel with their ‘no refund’ policy on special rate rooms refunded the entire amount of the stay. This was business not pleasure. Delta needs to get on board with their customer service. This is why I always fly Alaska. My mistake for trying something different. Update: Brittney the supervisor I spoke to was supposed to send voucher information via email at the end of the call and no surprise...she did not send it...so now I have to get back on the phone. It took them 7 hours to even get back to me. I can’t believe people use this airline. Alaska refunded a ticket for me with no hesitation. After sending them confirmation that a different conference was cancelled...they immediately refunded my money. Come on Delta. Get with it.,Negative

We needed to cancell our flight but Singapore Airline's were not so accommodating. After endless emails and holding on the phone for well over 40 minutes I was told that they can suspend our flights but we need to rebook by June. We will need to pay an extra $480 AUD each to do this. The original fare cost us $1288 in total. Given that we could no longer go on our cruise due to no other reason than the cruise being cancelled they still are not prepared to waiver the rebooking fee. Absolutely terrible after sales and customer support. We will be flying to Singapore in October to go on our cruise but will not be Flying with this Airline.,Negative

3553,"Today I experienced two bad encounters with Jet Blue employees. One of which was between myself and an employee and the other I was simply a witness too. I arrived at the airport early and attempted to see if I could get on an earlier flight that left in 1 hour rather than wait over 4 hours for my ticketed flight. I was rudely told that as a result of having bought the least expensive fare that I was not eligible to change my flight. The normal cost would have been $75, however this was not an option even though the plane was only half booked. The rude people at the desk simply tried to send me away as quickly as possible saying we don’t make the policy, we just follow the policies. I didn’t think of it at the time, but I could have simply gone on line and booked the one way for $149, but I only thought of it less than 30 minutes before take off. This meant that I couldn’t purchase the flight. I wish the rude person would have been more focused on solving my problem than getting me to go away. She went on to say if I wanted to complain to either call Jet Blue or go online, I said I’d use my own form of complaining and simply fly another airline. #2, I’m seating on my flight, over 4 hours later and watched a male flight attendant answer a question about whether he can change seats in our plane that’s roughly half full. The flight attendant responded as he pointed to an empty seat “that seats $50” he didn’t wait for a response from the person asking, he simply walked away. Really.... a sarcastic response to a simple innocent question, not to mention that the seat will go empty. Why not let the guy move and build some customer loyalty?",Negative

Both was wearing seat belt extensions and tried to move and then being told I can not sit in the back seats, Then I said Ill stand for the whole 3 hour flight, So they turn the seat belt sign and call in for not obeying.

3555,"On a Spirit Airlines flight from Fort Lauderdale to San Jose, Costa Rica, My family and I had an unforgettable and traumatizing experience. We were on our way to plan our wedding in Costa Rica when shortly after take off, medical personnel were called by Spirit Airline crew to assist in a medical emergency. I am CPR / ACSL certified and came to see if my assistance was needed. The crew was not prepared for the emergency and had a hard time getting the necessary equipment prepared for the medical personnel to attend to the ill passenger, who was an elderly woman. It was clear that the woman was unresponsive and it was found that she did not have a pulse. CPR was needed as well as a defibrillator and any other medication or equipment that was available. The woman was moved to the emergency exit row in front of three other passengers. The passengers in the exit row were not directed to another area of the plane and sat in their seats while myself and three other medical personnel preformed CPR for 35 minutes straight at their feet. Not only were we unassisted by the flight crew in CPR, but it was clear that there were no policies or procedures in place for this occurrence. If there are, none of them were communicated by the staff. The staff did not know what they had available to us, and gave us no instruction. We had to figure it out for ourselves as we went along. There was only one helpful crew member from Spirit Airlines keeping people from gathering around, and recording all the information. Nobody else did anything to help us. They did not divert the plane, and continued directly to SJO in Costa Rica. We were told we had another 49 minutes remaining on the flight. As we continued CPR it was evident that the woman would not be revived, and there was nothing we could do with the limited equipment we had. A passenger who is a medical doctor was on board, and called a time of death at 1310. If he was not there, CPR would have had to be continued for the remainder of the flight. We asked for a blanket to cover the now dead woman, and Spirit Airlines failed to provide one. We requested to move the dead woman away from the other passengers and Spirit was unable to do that as well. The alternative they offered was to put the corpse of the woman back in her seat, buckled in next to her friend. There was no consideration or care from the airline attendants in this matter. With no blankets available we had to take off her sweater and put it over her head instead. I went back to my seat to find my fiancé caring for another passengers nosebleed because no Spirit Airlines staff was available. Once we landed, paramedics were on scene, but the corpse was not removed from the plane. Instead, each passenger had to disembark walking passed the dead woman’s corpse with no cover over her but her own sweater. My son, started asking “Mommy, what’s that?” repeatedly and everything that happened really sunk in. I spent the rest of my trip going over everything that happened on the flight over and over again. The way that Spirit Airlines handled this situation was disgraceful and appalling. People deserve to hear what can happen during an emergency on Spirit Airlines. May that woman’s soul Rest In Peace and May her family know that we did everything we could. I hope in sharing this that Spirit Airlines equips their staff with proper procedures and education for handling emergency situations. I know that I will never place my family members in the hands of this incompetent company, who in the midst of an emergency acted so poorly and unprofessional.",Negative

3563,"Zero stars to all involved: Google Flights, Cheapoair.com, Qatar Airlines, Jet Blue Airlines, Sky Link Travel (New York) and LBF Travel. Started at Google Flights and found a good price, clicked book now. Was routed to Cheapoair.com to make the reservation. Both Google Flights and Cheapoair (as well as all US flight sales, by law) allow and advertise a 24-hour free cancelation.  Booked the flight with Cheapoair, but did not receive an email confirmation of the flight for about an hour after the flight was booked.  As the day progressed, the rest of my travel plans fell apart so I needed to cancel the flight about 7 hours after I originally booked it.  My email confirmation of the flight was from JetBlue.  The link in the email to cancel the flight didn’t work and I was prompted to call Jet Blue.  I called Jet Blue, but they only operated 1 leg of a 3 flight trip, so they said I couldn’t cancel with them, but I had to contact Qatar Airlines who was the real airline. I called Qatar, but they couldn’t help me because I didn’t have a booking confirmation code from them and they couldn’t find my reservation and suggested I contact my credit card/financial institution to see who made the charge for the flight.  I checked with my credit card, and Qatar made the charge.  I called Cheapoair, they had no record of my purchase or flight. I called Qatar back, and that person was able to find my flight information, but said I had to call my travel agent (presumably Cheapoair) to cancel.  Qatar does not allow cancelation in the first 24 hours after purchase (they are not a US company).  They said that their records showed my ticket was purchased by Skylink Travel.  I had never heard of that company, but they gave me a New York phone number.  I called that number and it rang for several minutes – no message or voicemail.  I googled Skylink Travel and found another number for them (also NY).  I called it and got a man that said that they do not sell airline tickets to individuals and that I would have to contact my travel agent.  I explained my situation (in tears at this point), and he was able to look up in his “travel agent system” and find my ticket number.  He gave me a different phone number to contact who he showed purchased the ticket – this time a CA number.  I called it but now it was after hours and I just looped through their phone system.  According to their number it is LBF Travel.  I googled them and confirmed I had called their only contact number.  Now it is late in the night and Qatar Airlines is closed.  Next morning, called both NY numbers for Skylink Travel.  The original number given to me by Qatar is now “all circuits busy” and not accepting calls (get only disconnected beeps – it never actually rings).  This happens all morning – it is Thursday and 10:30 in NY.  I called the 2nd Skylink Travel number and I am told again that they cannot help me because I am an individual. I call their billing dept and am transferred to some guy on his cell phone on the bus on his way to the office and he won’t talk to me.  I call again to a different extension in sales (as instructed), and am put on endless hold.  I call Cheapoair again to inquire about who Skylink Travel is.  They have never heard of them.  They still can’t find any record of me purchasing a ticket and insist that I have to cancel with Qatar.  I call my credit card again, talk to a person, and they confirm that Qatar Airlines charged my card.  I called Qatar again, and they very rudely insisted that (1) they didn’t charge my card for my flight and that I had to call my agent (which I explained that I did), (2) after acknowledging that they did issue the ticket that I couldn’t cancel the flight because they had no such 24-hour cancelation policy, and (3) it didn’t really matter anyway, because they couldn’t process a cancelation for me at any time because they didn’t book the flight.  I went back to Google Flights, and they can’t provide any help because all refunds or service issues need to be handled by the travel agent – Cheapoair.",Negative
3564,"First off I would like to start by saying that if I could give 0 stars I would. JetBlue in my opinion has been consistently downgrading in customer service, flight arrival times and people who they choose to hire. I just got back from a 4 day trip with my family for new years. Our flight going to Florida got delayed for over an hour and a half leaving from JFK and arriving in MCO. Fine. Today, I had a family emergency and needed to switch my flight from 2:52pm departure to the 12:07 departure. My girlfriend and I grabbed our things and jumped in the car by 10:10am to head to the airport. While IN AN UBER I called JetBlue and after holding on the line for 20 minutes, I finally got someone who ran my credit card for $150 same day flight change and he was able to switch my flight to the 12:07 departure. We arrived at the airport by 10:45. I quickly ran to the kiosk to print boarding passes and luggage tags. My boarding passes had printed but the luggage tags did not. Pressed for time and an emergency back at home, I scrambled for help. After the 3rd rep on the floor had tried to print my tags, they sent me to a customer service line, knowing that I had paid for a change in my flight and that I was going to miss my flight if I stood on this line. The rep on the floor responded with, “Sorry I cannot help you and you’re not skipping any lines.” Fine. Now after waiting on line for 45 minutes (now 11:40). The lady at the desk proceeded to tell me that my tags were not printing because I had changed my flight to same day. LADY, THE CONFIRMATION CODE WAS THE SAME. I have done this many times before. Clearly there was something wrong with their system. Fine. I had then asked her to switch me to the next available flight, since my gate was closing in 10 minutes and I had wasted about an hour in baggage check. She proceeded to switch my flight to a 1:14 departure and then told me that my bags weren’t paid for and I had to pay to check my bags. My girlfriend (having waited with me for over an hour on line already) answered quickly and told the lady that she had already paid and pre checked the bags when we booked the original flight. The lady then told me (with her finger in my face) “if she doesn’t cut the attitude I’m going to send you to the back of the line again and maybe you’ll get a flight out of here before 5pm.” I kept my composure and carried on. After searching her notes for another 7-8 minutes she had found that our bags had been pre checked and paid for. NOW, I asked about a refund for my $150 that I paid to have my flight switch to 12:07. She waived her hand and told me to call 1-800-JETBLUE and said “happy new year, bye.” Now we pass through security and arrive at our gate ONLY to see that our 1:14 flight had been delayed until 2:30. SO, I had paid $150 to get a 12:07 flight, deal with nasty employees who caused me to miss my flight. Get my flight changed, only to have it delayed and I basically left MCO airport 15 minutes before my originally scheduled departure time of 2:52.",Negative
3565,"I could give a zero star if it was possible. It has the worst customer service i've ever come accross. They have no respect for other people.

They made me wait for more than 30 minutes  and still nobody was willing to help me get my bags for the next connection.

I was among the last to get out of the plane beacuse of the baby and when i arrived at the bagage area, my bags had alreday been taken to their office. There were 3 women and one gentleman and they could not even want to listen to me, just pretending that they were extremely busy.

3566,Jetblue is easily one of the best airlines out there. I always go straight to them when booking a trip. Sure they can get a little pricey but its worth it because i never have a bad experience. Its so funny coz you read all the peoples reviews that are 1 star and the reason its 1 star is all things that either have nothing to do with jetblue or things that jetblue has no control over.

3567,"I have never written a bad review on any airline before, I have flown with at least 10 airlines internationally, and domestically. I have NEVER written a review, nor wanted to write a review for a company even if I did have a bad experience. That has changed drastically because of this airline. Any social media outlet I can find I will be posting this review to warn off anyone thinking about using them. My family and I had never flown with this airline before, but it was cheaper by a landsline so we decided to try it out. About a month later another family member was interested in going so we went ahead and booked her on the same flight since there were still availabilities. Fast forward a week before our departure, my aunt was horribly injured, and she's 84 years old. I call the airlines and the woman I spoke with was adamant that because it was a medical excuse we would receive a full refund as long as we turned in a doctor's note. Now, before I even start on how they treated the refund, I would like to talk on my personal interaction on the airline. This alone would have spurred me to write a review even without the second part of our dealings. So our first flight gets delayed one hour, then 45 minutes, then another 45, and we are counting the minutes to when we would land because our second flight to leave the country was 3 hours after our first flight SHOULD have landed. Now, I have traveled around the world numerous times, I lived abroad so I have dealt with my fair share of delays. BUT, and I emphasize the BUT, the airline ALWAYS contacted the next flights when dealing with delays in order to work with everyone's schedules. I have had many airlines delay the next flight for me enough that passengers wouldn't miss the flight going out. So coming off this rant, we miss the next flight. BY. FIVE. MINUTES. Do they call ahead and delay the next flight 30 minutes knowing there were connections? No. Now, that wouldn't even be a big deal normally because they get you on the next flight, but they only had ONE A DAY to Ecuador. So why did they not delay the flight knowing now they were going to have to put up multiple people in hotel rooms if they did not? Do not ask me, I sure do not know! We have to wait around an hour for a shuttle to take us to a hotel, then got next day to sit around in the airport for 9 hours. Pretty much missing a full day of work and a full day of vacation. They do not give a meal on an international flight, and you have to pay for any extras such as earphones, pillows, blankets, etc. which I have never seen before. Fast forward, fly back into the states and once again have to sit around and wait for 9 hours again! They must really love the number nine! When booking the next flight out (once they made us miss our second flight) the man behind the desk had the gall to ask me why we missed the flight because only if it was their fault would they put us in a hotel. ONLY IF IT WAS THEIR FAULT. Then he laughed and said ""how lucky we were"" because there were only 3 seats on the flight the next day (meaning if there weren't we would have been stranded another day? I definitely did not feel lucky!) So on top of that all they refuse to issue me a refund back on my card even though we have a doctor's note because we canceled the flight. It does not matter that it was medically necessary, we will only receive credit with a cancelation fee. NEVER. FLY. WITH. JETBLUE.",Postive

They were offering $150.00 up to $225.00 credit voucher towards a future flight for those willing to give up their seats. They were taking the cheapest bids first. I declined as the amount wasn't enough and we had to many other reservations tied into the date and time of our flight. (parking, rental car, hotel etc..) When we arrived at the airport the next day (in plenty of time) there were long lines at the Spirit check in. Since we already had our boarding passes, we weren't overly concerned. We did have a bag to check so we had to wait in line for that and after a long wait to the kiosk we had difficulty trying to check our bag. We got a representative after a bit and they tried and were unable to get our bag checked. We were sent to another Spirit counter to resolve and again there were long lines. It took so long we missed our flight. When we finally got to the counter, they told us it was too late to make our original flight. we figured we would have to wait for the next flight and when they checked the next available flight wasn't for ten days. We were only going away for seven. We asked four different reps including a supervisor, and they all just told us too bad, there is nothing they could do. This is why the lines were so long because they were of no help to most of the people there and just left us standing there with no recourse. We then went to the boards and sought out other airlines going to our destination. we went to two of them, no lines, no unhappy people, just helpful reps who were able to get us a flight, albeit, twenty- four hours alter but not ten days. Additionally, when we compared the prices they were within $25.00 of Spirit which we had purchased ninety days earlier. So we lost the flight and a hotel room for the night, parking, a day of the rental car and a day of our vacation but made the best of it regardless. When we went to return home, we again got to the airport four hours early because we had already experienced the Spirit nightmare and were taking no chances. Well, we relived it all over again. The same long lines, same run around, long story short they cancelled our return flight because we didn't make the first flight. They never emailed us as they did many times prior to our original flight. We had tried checking in the night before, but the website was not working and calling anytime is an exercise in futility. They push most everything through the website. After arguing with them and getting nowhere we were off to another airline. We were able to get another flight within an hour and a half of our original with no lines and no hassle. Again ,the cost were comparable to Spirits, with all their add on fees. Really think seriously and really compare cost and then you won't fly Spirit. Maybe if they lose a large part of their business, they will improve their customer service and experience. There were scores of unhappy Spirit fliers in the lines we waited in",Negative

He would not take my cash nor care that I did not have enough money in my account to cover the fees. Finally I begged them to let me call a friend to pay for over the phone. Reluncuctntly, they sgreed. There were tons of people in line that had way bigger/fatter luggage than me and I was was singled out.  This was definitely a case of reverse racism. I feel violated.

The aircraft itself are always clean and comfortable. Side story: I had a credit to Jetblue from a canceled trip and called the customer services to use it towards a different flight. Right off the bat there were complications. There was an issue with the tickets I was attempting to buy and there computer system wasn't allowing them to use my credit.

She was easy to reach both via phone and email.  It was the latter that was particularly helpful since we shared information (potential schedules, my travel details, etc) ahead of our conversations so we had visuals to support what we were discussing.

I was very unfortunate to come across an official of theirs at Fort Lauderdale Airport who had one of the most arrogant and contemptuous dispositions I have ever come across whilst telling me to place 2 laptops on my laps for a 2.5-hour journey to JFK. I was quite unsettled after this encounter at FLL and for the rest of the journey. I reported this to the 'Speak Up' team at JetBlue, and all I received was a bog-standard ""We recognize that you're disappointed with what occurred onboard your flight ... evaluating any applicable coaching opportunities ... Thanks for getting in touch"" type response. A very bewildering response from the customer services team. Having recognised that there was disappointment at the customer's end, a decent, reputable company would have issued an apology, but not JetBlue. They stopped short of doing this. Really sad. The irony is that every other member of staff that I came across did a fantastic job, were diligent and knowledgeable about what they did and had very high levels of empathy in a number of cases that I observed.

3607,"Here's when things get bad, I called the airline everyday for an update and they did not want to talk about their claim process if the bag was never found and the reps were callous to say the least and acted as they had no compassion about a man being on vacation with barely any cloths, they said that I would have to wait 5 days before they can discuss the claim process which was a slap in the face as I only wanted to put my mind at ease. So when I flew back into JFK I went straight to the baggage office and they couldn't find my luggage, it was either lost or stolen. I gather it was stolen because it was a nice Calvin Klein bag with thousands in valuables inside which I regret packing but I was going on vacation and wanted to bring some of my nice things. So now over 2 weeks later I have not even received my $30 refund which I paid to check the bag that's now lost, the refund was initiated on the 15th of October and today is the 28th, they said it takes 7 to 10 days and we are on day 13 since it was initiated. Now to the claim process which is the very worst of it all as if it can get worst. There claim process takes them a full 30 days to confirm the bag is lost and on average about 45 days before a reimbursement payment is paid, I submitted a list of items that was in my luggage with pictures of me wearing items from the past that was valuable as proof of ownership like my designer glasses, Rolex date just and other items. Not only does their claim policy of a cap of $1,500 but the most DISRESPECTFUL PART OF IT ALL is the lady handling my claim said my pictures were not acceptable as proof of purchase and I had to provide receipts for everything in the bag. My electronics, jewelry and glasses were to 2 to 10 years old and WHO KEEPS RECEIPTS AROUND FOR THINGS THEY OWNED FOR YEARS AND HOW IS IT THEY CAN'T ACCEPT PICTURES OF ME WEARING THESE ITEMS AS PROOF??? So that's my experience and I will avoid flying Jet blue at all cost in the future, at the end of this 45 day period I'm gonna follow up with a video and post it on youtube and all of my social media. #jetbluesucks.

3608,"This JetBlue is the worst airline I have experienced. I had the flight with JetBlue on 16 August. When I reached Detroit, I didn't receive of one of my Suitcases (it had 23.5 kg weights). At the airport, I filled the form to track the status of my bag. From that time unitl now, every day I call them to ask the status of my bag. They hardly answered and always promised me to call back, but no one called me back. My staff inside my suitcase was so important and necessary for me. Always I said them but they never paid attention. I really spent the hard situation during this time. I was a new student here, didn't know anyone, didn't have car, and I was not familiar with Detroit. I lost my staff inside the bag and couldn't buy them. The weather suddenly became cold in Detroit and I didn't have warm cloths because they were inside my lost suitcase. I called them, talked about the situation, wanted them to find my bag or compensate their mistake. They really didn't pay attention. I lost my weight and became ill because of the cold weather. I was crying sometimes and really need their help, but they were really irresponsible people. After long time, they paid me only 650 $ for delay and wanted me to fill the form related to staff inside the bag with their price and details. I spent more than 10 hours to fill the form. The staff inside the form was really important and valuable for me. I really love them and I lost them. The expenses that I estimate in my form became more that 4000 $. But, two days ago they sent me message that we only want to pay you 250$ as compensation. JetBlue is really baaaaaaaaaaaaaaad airline. Not only they are not responsible for your suitcase and always you fear that they lost your staff, but also if they lost your staff, they never compensate it. Never try JetBlue.",Negative
3609,JetBlue flights are delayed 99 percent of the time for unexplained reasons and there is no compensation or accommodation offered.  Sometimes I believe that it’s just because they don’t have the crew or the check-in agents.  Once I was on a JetBlue flight and it aborted the takeoff because the pilots discovered some equipment problem exactly during the takeoff. It was a pretty nerve wrecking for the passengers.  If you value your safety and being on time and don’t really care about their stale blue chips that they offer try to avoid flying with JetBlue.,Negative

We had asked and paid for a window seat, when we got on the plane we had the only seats on the plane that did not have a window seat. We asked if we could move to a window seat as my partner felt claustrophobic, the cabin crew were quite rude and advised once everyone is on the plane we could move seats. Everyone was on the plane and they ignored us so we moved ourselves to some empty seats. On the way back the exact same thing happened but this time the company had made duplicate seat tickets so it was a shambles, people walking around the plane with no seats, families being separated, luckily our seats were not duplicated but again we did not have a window seat we had asked for. The staff were so rude, starring and giving horrible fake smiles which made feel very uncomfortable. When trying to get down the isle whilst the staff were serving drinks and food they wouldn't move out of your way, I understand the isle are small and it is a bit of a struggle to move around but even when you waited for them to finish they still came towards you expecting you to move out the way when indeed it should be a two way thing, they starred at you and gave you horrible looks if you were waiting for them to finish which is not how I expect staff to act. None of them had any manors saying sorry or thank you if you did move out the way. If we had paid little money for these flights I would probably expect this service but we did not so I did not find this behaviour acceptable.

I tried for 3 hours to get help and ran from Place to Place at the airport and met several customers who weren't satisfied With Pegasus. They wouldn't give me a New ticket either, they made me buy a much more expensive ticket, and the price was higher than if I bought it from other Companies.

3656,"Below is the complaint to pegasus. However They have rejected my complain and I am now going through the court for a refund On May 10, 2014, my boyfriend and I were supposed to fly from Copenhagen to Erbil, Iraq on Pegasus. On the way to our final destinationy, we were going to change planes twice within Turkey. Although I am Danish, my boyfriend holds an alien passport. Before we left--in order to ensure there would not be any complications--we contacted the Turkish embassy and were told, explicitly, that because we were only changing planes twice and were remaining within the confines of the airport, he would not be a visa. Please see the attached signed letter from the Turkish embassy.  When we arrived at the airport, we had no problem checking in or going through security. However, when we were in the waiting area preparing to board, my boyfriend was informed by Pegasus personal that he needed a visa to enter Turkey. Despite telling the Pegasus staff that we were told by the Turkish embassy that he did not need a visa, he was not allowed to board the plane. Repeatedly, we explained the situation to multiple Pegasus crew members, but we were still told that he could not board the plane.  I cannot tell you how heartbroken we were that the Pegasus crew would not allow my boyfriend to board the plane. My boyfriend's mother lives in Iraq and was recently diagnosed with breast cancer. We planned this trip not for holiday but to visit her and to cheer up his mother. Since his mother was eagerly expecting us, when we realized Pegasus would not allow him to board the plane (despite the fact that he would not be violating Turkish law by changing planes twice in Turkey without a visa) we were forced to buy tickets on a different airline in order to reach his mother in Iraq.  While we have heard positive things about Pegasus from friends in the past (as well as having a pleasant experience checking in at the airport) we are angry that the Pegasus crew prohibited my boyfriend from boarding the plane despite the fact that we had previously received confirmation from the Turkish embassy that his situation did not merit a visa.  We have previously contacted Pegasus, and we were directed to email this address. Given that we were not able to board the plane through no fault of our own, we would like our initial tickets on Pegasus to be refunded and the more cost that that the new tickets have cost. A total Price of 10.482.74 Danish kr. Had my boyfriend actually needed a visa or had we been late and missed the plane, we would understand that we ourselves would have been to blame. However, in this situation, despite taking extensive precautions by contacting and verifying my boyfriend?s situation and our travel plans with the Turkish embassy, our inability to complete our travel is due to the Pegasus crew at the Copenhagen airport who prohibited my boyfriend from boarding the plane.",Negative

In my dealings with Egyptair, my communications have been ignored most of the time. The service I have received from Egyptair throughout my entire experience with them has been extremely poor and very disappointing. Egyptair eventually came back to me with an offer to pay only 68% of my missing suitcase claim. Except for the things that Egyptair can never pay me back for (the three days of holiday in Rome that we lost and will never get back, my wedding earrings that I took with me on holiday, the sentimental souvenirs of the places we visited), they are not even willing to pay me the full amount of the missing items in my suitcase.

On the way home, we found a star alliance member flight, Egypt Air, which served a non-stop route from Cairo to JFK.  We thought this 12 hour flight would be ideal as we would likely be exhausted from all the sightseeing.  THIS WAS A MISTAKE. The captain smoked cigarettes throughout the whole flight.  The aircraft smelled of smoke and flight attendants acknowledged this, confirmed it was the captain smoking, and proceeded to spray a hideous perfume around the cabin to help mask the stench.  This made it worse!  The entire aircraft was coughing...ironically the no smoking sign stayed illuminated throughout the whole flight. I find it ironic that the entire airline is dry (no beer, wine or liquor), but the captain can fill the air with cigarette smoke for a long haul flight.

We also found out that my name had been changed on the booking so the hotel were reluctant to let us check in at all. The room we booked was a Club room, with double bed and lounge access, but we were shown to a basic twin room. It seems that CTrip either changed booking details themselves or outsourced the booking to Destinations of the World. We discovered only when trying to resolve this issue that the final booking was made by dotw.com. This was never communicated to us and it made resolving the issue extremely difficult.

3674,"The worst possible agent to book a flight. We had to cance our flight due to an emergency. Rebooking the flight was a real nightmare. I have called the customer service more than 10 times and I was told that an agent will call me to give me prices for new flights. However, 3 days later their agents still can’t figure out how much it is going to cost to change the flights. In other words it takes them 3 days (and still no confirmation) to figure out a simple price - something that usually takes seconds. If a person needs to change for the next day it is impossible. The staff doesn’t speak fluent English and the whole process is rediculous. Nothing compared to Expedia or any other travel agency. If you want a smooth booking NEVER use Ctrip! The great paradox - day three - got a call from the agent in the morning (asking for flights that I am interested in. Even though that I have provided that information more than 10 times with their customer service department). Anyway, they write down the flights and tell me that they are going to call me back later with prices (they have confirmed that there is availability in the given flights). 5 hours later, they call back to tell me that they have a price but it is not longer valid because there is no availability in the given flights. They tell me that they can check for business class but it will take some time and will call me back again. My simple thought is - ok, when they call would their price be valid this time or the flight would have become unavailable by then. As I said the whole process of rebooking is a burecracy paradox. They call to tell you that they will call again to give you a price. And when they call again same things happens again and again. Ctrip you better figure out your own processes and use a simple logic so that you avoid such situations! No wise person should ever use that service until it is significantly improved!

Trip.com originally was an American run and owned company with customer service objectives but it was then purchased by one of the largest travel companies in China and was renamed C-Trip.com and customer service became irrelevant. For our 25th anniversary I booked a return flight to Perth starting on Thursday 14/6/18 however due to unknown roadworks we arrived 45 minutes before our flight was due and issues occurred from then on with the Virgin Airlines kiosk system refusing to allow us to print our boarding passes. In the end we were not able to board our flight and I tried the Virgin Service Desk who advised as this is a class 'M' ticket it can be changed for another flight for an amendment fee of $100 but it can only be done via the booking agent, in this case CTrip.com so I call C-Trip.com for assistance. Ctrip.com refuse to assist and advise me they cannot amend the ticket (which is false and incorrect information because Ctrip.com are incompetent and don’t even know the terms and conditions of the tickets they purchased from Virgin Airlines). Ctrip.com refuse to help and advise it is Virgin Airlines’ responsibility to amend the ticket and refuse to accept the terms and conditions on the Virgin Airline tickets which is clearly documented that the tickets are ‘M’ class tickets and can be changed to another flight with an amendment fee of $100 BUT can only be changed by the booking agent being Ctrip.com but Ctrip.com refuse. I constantly ask for a manager or supervisor to escalate this to but each and every time I call, I am advised none are available (pathetic customer service) but that someone will call me. Nine hours later, no one from Ctrip.com calls me and every time I call and quote the complaint reference number #5594282985, Ctrip.com staff mysteriously hang up the phone (happened 4x Thurs 14/6/18 9:30am - 11:30am). Each time I call I advise Ctrip.com that the Virgin Airline tickets were purchased by Ctrip.com as the booking agent and that they are class 'M' tickets and it can be changed (as advised by the Virgin Service desk) and Ctrip.com advise they will call back in an hour with an amendment (starting as at 10:00am) but I ask to speak to a manager / supervisor and Ctrip.com hangs up and no call back is received each and every time. I end up out of pocket an extra $400.00 as I purchase other tickets on my own directly through Virgin Airlines and thanks to Ctrip.com’s lack of skill, lack of service we are stuck at the airport for over 12 hours before we are able to catch a flight. Mind you we missed the 8:35am flight but if Ctrip.com had provided any assistance and amended the tickets as requested on numerous occasions, we could have been on the 12:00pm flight instead of waiting a total of 12 hours for another flight. Emails dated 14/6/18 are sent to Ctrip.com requesting management respond to my horrible experience due to Ctrip.com’s lack of skill, lack of knowledge and lack of customer service but this is also ignored. Due to this, I am out of pocket $400.00 AUS dollars on that day. Months later I receive an email offering compensation in the paltry amount of $35.00. NEVER AGAIN Ctrip.com and I recommend all customers to go elsewhere because Ctrip.com and Trip.com is NOT the original Trip.com. 6/3/19 Update to Ctrip - Oliver. Oliver regardless of Ctrip's restrictive Ts&Cs, the tickets were M class Virgin Airline economy tickets and Virgin would allow Ctrip to amend the tickets without issue but Ctrip refused, were inflexible, provided no assistance or options, constantly hung up and only made the entire experience horrific instead of applying common sense (even a reasonable fee would have been acceptable).",Negative

Oh and of course, no luggage at Heathrow when they finally made it back after 25 hours of travel. They are a disgusting airline and I would never fly with them again. My wedding is in one week so we have had to pay out 2k for direct flights home as we could be stuck her for 2-3 days before getting a flight otherwise.",Negative

3702,"Not sure why this site has such bad reviews here. First of all it does have good customer service - especially if a ticket has been paid for. Usually matters are dealt with very quickly by phone and by this I am referring to flight tickets and train tickets. In my experience I have never had a situation where any refund was outstanding or had to quibble. Also, for travel in China, this website is an excellent way to book train tickets (in China) and the app version even shows you how many seats are left on each train. Book the ticket and collect it from any train station in China and tickets are issued within 30 minutes. That is good service. Most people in China seems to use the Trip app to book train tickets. As for hotels, I have used Ctrip to book many hotels in Shanghai and also as Trip.com to book hotels in Europe and never had a problem.",Postive

3705,"I booked a hotel in Hong Kong using Trip.com, a total of PHP39,000+ which is payable at the hotel, but they need to pre-authorize the card first to confirm the booking. So basically they charge my debit card on the day of the booking which is Sept 2,2018 for my Sept 11-17 booking in Hong Kong. I called them Sept 6 to refund me the money and ask them if I could just choose the prepayment or pay online option since they already charge me, yet that is now possible, they said that they will just refund me once I checked in successfully at the hotel. Sept 11 - I checked in at the Hotel Sept 12- They charged me the same amount which is PHP39,000+ Sept 12 - They refunded me the same amount PHP 39,000+ (so they can charge and refund the same day, eh?) Sept 12 Evening - I contacted them via chat asking about the charge and refund they made on that day. And the customer support quite not sure about it, but she confirmed that they already released the refund on that day. The question is, what refund is it for the Sept 12 charge or for the Sept 2 charge? They said that I do not need to worry anything because the refund will be on my account after 20 days. I contacted them today, Oct 4,2018 - because I am not seeing any refund on my account, I called the bank to see any floating amount and to my expectation, there's none. So base on our conversation, the support said that there's no amount left or charge because the preauthorization failed on my payment. Which is not true, because it will not confirm my reservation. So she said that she will check with their finance department today and see what happened.

3706,"I flew with United Airlines from the US to the UK for business purposes. My flights were on time and my luggage arrived as it should have, so the basic requirements for a flight were all met. If you just want to get from A to B, the airline seemed to be fine, at least for me (although I've read lots of negative reviews about United elsewhere). However, the service is very bad compared with other airlines, sometimes ridiculously bad. Thus, if I have the choice in the future, I won't fly with United again. Just to put this in perspective - I fly with Ryanair a lot and I have to say their service is much better (because it is reliable and predictable, as long as you stick to the rules). As most airlines, United offers passengers to select a seat online in advance - I was trying to do that well in advance, but I had only about three options, middle seats and aisle seats. I had wanted a window seat. It was a relatively small aircraft, so one out of three passengers could have a window seat, which is a lot. I tried again at check-in, at the United counter at the airport and on boarding the aircraft - every time I was asked to pay US$ 170 for a window seat! Any other airline lets you choose a window seat for free! They are really trying to squeeze money out of you at every stage, even though their flights are not cheaper than other mainstream airlines (e.g. Aer Lingus, British Airways). When I was in the aircraft, it was obvious that most passengers on window seats had not actively selected a window seat - even when we were flying directly over Manhattan, they would rather watch a movie than look out of the window. Some of them may have preferred a window seat to avoid having to get up when their neighbour needed to go to the toilet etc. but I am convinced that this didn't apply to all of them. I would also assume that not everyone was familiar with the seat selection process online, which requires slightly more advanced knowledge of flight booking processes. Rather, the most likely explanation is that United had allocated them there, so they would block the free window seats to those passengers who would want to select them online, hoping that these would then go on to purchase a window seat in a more expensive area of the plane (which they call ""economy plus""; plus stands for ""more expensive""). On one United flight food and drink cost money, on another one it didn't. That was confusing and inconsistent. I was really thirsty on the flight where it did cost money. United is not a discount airline, so they should really always include food and drink, or else radically reduce prices (as Ryanair does). The touch screens in the aircraft didn't work very well, the old system with buttons which other airlines use is much more reliable. Movies were frequently interrupted and it was hard to click on anything with this touch-screen. Finally, it's the first time in my life that I've been insulted by service personnel. This honour goes to United as well. I was half-awake when a stewardess asked me whether I'd like juice or water to drink. She didn't understand me when I said juice, OK, fair enough - it was really noisy, I had just woken up, it was 5 am or so, this can happen. To make things easier, I just took a cup of juice, since it was just there anyway. She then went on to complain to all the other passengers about me and said - ""look at this guy, I can't understand what he says, I couldn't read his lips, oh my god, his accent is so strong!"" honestly, what the hell. I didn't insult her in any way and this is someone working in the service sector. I live in the UK, I've never had any problem communicating myself with anyone. Of course I don't have a North American accent, but this was about getting ""water"" or ""juice"", come on, how could you even infer an accent from a single word said in a very noisy environment. I could have never imagined such a low level of professionalism from a person who works in the service sector. ""Don't insult your passengers"" should be the first rule flight attendants should learn, I would think. She can think what she said, but never say it out loud. Goodbye United, I won't come back!",Negative

They cancelled my return ticket saying that I was a no-show for the outbound flight although I sat in my seat in the outbound flight and even gate-checked a bag.  They wasted more than two hours of my valuable time during my trip and caused a lot of stress.  They didn't even know how this happened.  No one apologized to me for their mistakes as of date.

We were stranded, 10's of thousand of KM from home, negotiating with an anonymous unknown voice at the end of a phone who kept promising to call back in 10-15 minutes and then took hours to get back to us. Instead of our planned route home we were booked on a 14.5 hour flight, a 3 hour layover, a 11.5 hour flight, an 11 hour layover and then a 9 hour flight home. When told this was unacceptable and that we wanted to speak to the voices manager, it took 3 hours for them to call back with a reasonable alternative. Our 23 hour flight home ended up taking 57 hours to get us home and a night of missed sleep while we tried to find a faster way home. We have approached the airline for compensation only to be told that how we booked our tickets was in breach of the T&C's of every airline we flew and at any time if we had been asked for our loyalty card or proof of membership we could have been refused boarding.

On their recommendations Trip.com said it would be okay to use my initials instead of my full first name. So I booked my tickets using my full surname and the initials of my first and second name. Being slightly worried that this would be an issue, I contacted Trip.com who told me that I should contact the airlines just to be certain. I obliged and contacted each of the three airlines I used. Two fo the airlines easily and efficiently accepted a name change (because they wouldn't accept initials contrary to Trip.com's recommendation). HOWEVER, the third airlines, which contains the two international legs of this trip as well as an internal flight in Thailand, refused and said I would need to cancel, refund and rebook. These flights are non refundable. I contact Trip.com and have to wait several days, send numerous emails, numerous phone calls and they eventually come back to me saying the exact same thing as the airline. Not even addressing the fact that the flights are non refundable. I've sent more emails requesting assistance for Trip.com to rebook these flights for me, since it was their recommendation that put me in this situation. The response I keep getting?

3748,"We just came back from holiday, so I haven't replied or posted anything after the last review. Oliver replied back and said we agreed with the solution CTrip provided. Do we have a choice? Returning 3,000 RMB out of 6,300 RMB, is NOT the solution we were asking for. The CTrip app forced us to book a hotel without our knowledge and consent. Has the app been fixed? Or is CTrip still tricking other customers with it? The CTrip agent was extremely arrogant and rude. Has there been any quality control? Does anybody check and listen in to their agents talking with their customers? CTrip has a policy on when to reply to their customers. Really? My numerous emails were unanswered for more than 2 weeks before I started posting in social media and still hasn't been replied. What kind of policy does CTrip follow? Should we expect no response as CTrip's policy on replying to customers' questions and concerns? After stealing 6,300 RMB from your customer and returning only 3,000 RMB, do you consider that as agreement on our part? And the only reason we even got 3,000 RMB back was because I went to social media. If it wasn't for Trustpilot, we wouldn't have even gotten part of our money back. For those of you who are wondering, yes, we went to the China government complaint hotline. They tried to help, but CTrip just dragged on and on and delayed over and over again. And here's another thing. After telling us they will return 3,000 out of 6,300 RMB, they told me to remove all my posting from Trustpilot. No, I will not remove it and not only that, I'm posting another one. You cannot cheat somebody out of 6,300 RMB and return less than half and expect me to be happy or satisfied and remove my posting.

We paid a good 450RMB, approximately 90SGD for that additional 40kg. Which is strangely ridiculous since my boyfriend and I only paid 48SGD for a 20kg top up two ways. I won’t deny that Ctrip did try to remedy the situation by offering to pay for the 1000RMB (100RMB per kg) we were charged by Scoot for the nonexistent baggage we purchased. This also explains the two-star rating instead of one. However, I believe the hassle just isn’t worth it. We still lost a good 450RMB to false baggage and had to deal with being the middle man between Scoot and Ctrip. Would not recommend.",Negative

3760,"Hi, Am Dalu Baburaj, Myself & My friends namely •	Anand •	Aravind •	Aswin recently made a trip to Russia for the FIFA World Cup 2018. Our tickets were booked in your airlines ie Aeroflot airlines from Moscow ie Sheremetyevo International Airport to Delhi ie Indira Gandhi International Airport on 18th June 2018. The flight was scheduled to depart at 7.05 PM on 18th of June 2018. We had done the boarding and security check-in by 5.00 PM and were waiting for the gates to be open.  Once the gates were open due to rush we had to wait in the lounge and we reached the gates when the attendant announced the final call. The attendant named Michael was doing something on the computer and was not letting us in saying that the bus has left the place. The bus was staying in front of us and he was not letting us in. He asked us to walk out and closed the gate saying that we are late by 1 minute. We were asked to walk out through the exit door and were not told what to do next. We approached the Aeroflot office in the Airport and we faced very rude behaviour from the lady with black hair who was in duty on 18th June 2018 in between 20.00 pm – 22.00pm. This lady was also rude at the FIFA volunteers and even they have registered a complaint against her to their senior officials. We took the help of the FIFA volunteers and with their help, we had a talk with the deputy manager of the airport and received the baggage which was loaded in the aircraft, from there we came to know that our loaded baggage was offloaded from the aircraft and the aircraft departed after 19.30 PM. We were asked to book another ticket and the reason provided for the same was that we were late by 1 Minute which was totally absurd as we were there at the boarding gates at the final call. We had connecting flights from Delhi and all the bookings were cancelled and we had to rebook another flight via Dubai to Cochin with a layover of 6 hours that too without the meal. I had to spend additional money for the lodging, ticket from Moscow to Cochin and from there to Bengaluru and even for the food, just because of the rough attitude and EGO of the gate attendant named Michael towards the foreigners.",Negative

3763,"Jetstar criminals: They attempt to steal 300 EUR from me and my wife by not honoring the ""free cancel and refund"" program that they advertised during March 18-19 2020, in response to sudden travel restrictions due to Corona. In retrospect they try to change the refund offer into a flight vouchers program. This is not acceptable and we have been clear that we consider reporting them to the police and customer protection authorities in Singapore, Indonesia and Hong Kong. Hopefully our bank's chargeback will recover the funds.

JetStar had no ""cancel flight"" option inside their web site, and their own staff were surprised to see this. Me, my wife and the JetStar staff, tried their phone JetStar's customer support hotline and there was no answer, also we tried to open an online chat and that one did not answer too, even afte waiting 20-30 minutes, standing at the airport desk.

3766,"A very disappointing experience. Expect condescending staff and opportunistic cash grabs wherever possible. In this case it was $130 to pay for 2 bags (1 per person) that were slightly overweight. They have the scales there ready to go Just before you board the plane and this is despite the check-in baggage allowance being 20kg and therefore no overall additional burden on the aircraft whatsoever. Add to this staff talking down to you like a child?! Additionally, this was a return flight - the initial flight was with the parent carrier (Qantas) where a different weight limit applies, despite both flights appearing on the same ticket and under a Qantas letter head. AVOID",Negative
3767,"Jetstar should be offering refunds not vouchers during the Covid-19 crisis. Beware: They also change your flights without notifying you. Even once the flight is cancelled, they only offer a voucher. Jetstar tricks their customers out of a refund in which they are entitled to. If you call them to discuss your options, be prepared to be on hold for minimum 4 hours before being disconnected. They give a short deadline to accept a voucher, expecting a decision without being able to discuss your options with them, as they give no other option but a voucher. You can only get a refund if they cancel the flight and you demand it. However, they offer you a voucher, unprompted, in a way to trick you into accepting just prior to them cancelling the flight. They merely treat their customers like peasants.  Eventually, I got through to them via Messenger. It was like talking to a robot. They repeat their phrases as if it is scripted. Terrible customer service, just another greedy company. Zero stars.",Negative

3799,"First of all, you think during all the travel you may be a problem because the planes are very uncomfortable, loud and they shake a lot. We traveled from Paris to Tokyo(16 hours) with a connecting flight in Moscow. We saw on the website they have a lot of different special meals, so we ordered 3 times vegetarian meals for both flights, but a little later we received emails telling us the reservation wasn't possible. The day of the flight we realized there were a lot of people with vegetarian meals and we could not eat anything during 16 hours! For the return flight, they changed the schedule of the second flight without sending us any notification / email and we arrived 2 hours late. The entertainment is very poor, bad quality of sound and movies. I would not recommend this airline and I won't travel with them again.",Negative
3800,"1) Beware if you need special meals, it might be very complicated or impossible to get them! DETAIL: I've been very disappointed with Aeroflot. For our first flight, we called the Russian call centre to reserve 2 vegetarian meals. We had to wait more than 10 minutes online. They told us it had been done. 10-15 minutes later, we received an email saying the meals had been automatically cancelled and that they were not available on these flights. I therefore called back the French call centre to ask them why this had happened because our flights were long enough for them to offer us these meals. She checked but couldn't get any answer and reserved another 2 different vegetarian meals again. Same story... After 10-15 min, we received a cancellation email. I thus contacted the call centre by email to explain the entire problem because I had lost enough time on the phone with them. She answered she didn't know what had happened but that now we were sure to have a meal. However, once again we received a cancellation email. I replied that I was very disappointed but never received anything back. We therefore had no special food on our way there whereas others had... On our return flight, I emailed the Service centre to complain and ask for a meal for our flight. She said there was a problem with the computer for the first flight. She ordered the meals for us. As it wasn't clear if the meals had been ordered for both passengers, I emailed the call centre again and they told me that exceptionally we could have special meals but that on two legged flights it is technically IMPOSSIBLE! 2) The airplanes are not comfortable at all. Very surprising for a ""non low cost"" company. The audio and video entertainment system is very limited with lots of old or Russian choices. Even if you find good options to watch or listen to, the sound quality is so poor that after 2 trial on 2 different movies, I stopped watching them because I couldn't hear anything. 3) They changed the time of the second ""leg"" of our return flight without sending an email. We noticed when we did the online check in. 4) Staff doesn't know anything (in Paris nor in Tokyo) as they always tell us that it is centralised in Moscow so they cannot help you with anything special.",Negative
3801,"Horrible, aloof service. No paid upgrades (hurt my knee on vacation, couldn't buy extra legroom or upgrade to higher class, so my knee wouldn't be in a locked bended position for 10 hours). Cramped seats if you're semi-tall (1.90 for me). Food is even more tasteless than your run of the mill airline food (apart from the russian fruit leather thing, which was really addictive).

3802,"Just got home from our trip to Thailand. We went from Copenhagen via Moscow to Phuket. When we arrived in Phuket my baggage was not on the plane from Moscow. And I was not the only one. 20 other passengers were in the same situation. We wrote to Aeroflot from Thailand (18 dec. 2016) to tell them about the problem and to tell them, that we needed to buy several things in Thailand due to the missing baggage. We got an autoreply, which told us, that we would hear from them within 5 days (haven't heard from them yet (30 dec). The same thing happened on our return flight from Phuket to Copenhagen via Moscow. No baggage. When we arrived in Copenhagen both mine AND my girlfriend's baggage were left behind in Moscow. The same happened to 15-20 other passengers. If you want to travel and need your baggage on your destination AND want your baggage when you return.....DON'T use Aeroflot 😞",Negative
3803,"My boyfriend and I went from Copenhagen via Moscow to Phuket Thailand with aeroflot - and then the same route for the return trip. When we arrived in Phuket, my boyfriend's baggage was not on the plane - they had kept it on the transit in Moscow (with 20 other people's luggage from the same connecting flight), and we were informed it would arrive the following day in Phuket (which it did). Then on our return trip - also with transit in Moscow - we landed in Copenhagen, and BOTH of our suitcases were not with the plane. Again they had left them in Moscow (also with 20 other people's suitcases and belongings).... We were then told that because of New Years (we landed on the 29th of december), our suitcases might not get to us before early January!!! This is just so absolutely NOT ok. So if you're prepared to wait for days after arrival for your baggage, then definitely choose Aeroflot, if not then just DON'T book your plane tickets with them!!!",Negative

Only airline can do it. Me- make sense. Me-. Can you atleast refund my Taxes? I believe I can get that back Airline staff- no, you invested in our products with another agent, we can't pay you the taxes back.

3809,"On Monday the 9th of March 2020 my 12 year old daughter  and I travelled from Hobart to Melbourne   We were required to travel due to commitments at the Royal Children’s Hospital on Tuesday morning the 10th March 2020.   My daughter Freya has complex medical issues and we were going to talk to doctors about an upcoming bone marrow transplant.      Our return flight JQ 0713 was due to leave at 1310pm. Due to the need for further treatment at the hospital our flights were pushed back to 1600pm JQ 0711. When we were in the process of boarding that flight at Terminal 4, my daughter’s name was called out and she was asked to attend the service desk.    Upon arrival at the service desk Jetstar staff realised she was only a child and appeared awkward and embarrassed.    I addressed the fact we were together and it was only at that stage they told us both our seats were cancelled.   I explained that my daughter had undergone medical treatment at the hospital that day, we were stressed and exhausted and the urgency for us to return to Hobart for Freya to have her weekly in home transfusion of Evogam.  That made no difference to Jetstar staff attitudes.       I was disgusted at their indifference and lack of compassion. We were told there was a flight leaving at 8pm and staff gave us meal vouchers.  I was required to write down my email address as staff were going to email us some flight vouchers Staff did not supply me with anything in writing about the new flights.   Staff said it was QF 1017 and that it would be leaving around 8pm.   I wrote this down on my hand.   I asked about tickets which they replied they could not print out and that they would be available to be collected before the flight left.  At no time did they mention which terminal we should go to  nor did they supply us anything in writing about the change in flights. The customer service was appalling and staff attitudes were extremely discourteous. I then returned to the food court area and awaited several hours for our flight to appear on the board.  When it did not appear I returned to the service desk at Terminal 4.  There was no one there.   When I found a Jetstar staff member they informed us our flight had left from a different terminal.  They suggested we go to Terminal 1 or 2 and check.   When I did this I was told by staff that the flight had departed at 745pm. There were no flights after that time that were flying to Hobart.    My ill daughter was in tears and extremely upset as a result of the entire experience. As a result, I was required to book two new flights  and pay for overnight accommodation  This is the worst experience I have ever encountered with an airline.",Negative

The planes (Since they were international) were super nice. The meals were nice, and we had several choices. The selection of movies and series was big and the attendants were helpful if needed. I didn't experience delay or anything else. The ONLY negative thing I can say about aeroflot is that they had some difficulties with the temperature in the planes. One flight was super warm. I couldn't sleep because I felt so warm and uncomfortable. My friend had the same problem but it seemed like the majority on the plane were able to sleep despite the temperature. Another flight was super cold. I had to wear the blanket they gave us, my scarf and and my jacket - and i was still freezing. But rather that than it being too warm!",Postive

Also, I called United last night to check on the name change and together we found out that they got the booking details from me, charged my card and then called United to make the change for free. Then the United agent called them to investigate and they told her they are not farekingdom and have nothing to do with United. She called the same number I did. Please check other reviews on them on Trustpilot and Google. They have scammed many by buying ads on google to make them show up first when you search for airline contacts. They showed up first when I googled the United Airlines customer service number. I have already disputed the charge but I will do everything to expose these awful liars and also can barely speak decent english so it's obvious their fake good reviews are from themselves.",Negative
3856,"If i could give a zero star i will, this company is made of scam artist so stay away,  i was trying to change my united airline reservation and somehow that have paid for advertisement on google so they came up first, immediately i noticed the mistake i ended the call until one of there  rep who said his name was SHEN called back claiming they are also united airlines, i was suspicious when he was trying to force me to get my refund for the ticket which i refused so he told me he was going to put it on hold till i make up my mind the next day, next thing i know i  got an email  saying i cancelled my flight and my card was charged for 200dollars.  Did i authorize the charge on my card? NO. Did i authorize my ticket to be cancelled for a refund? NO i dint not....  i tried calling back and this people are trained professional liars, they claim they don't know anyone bearing that name,until i finally got to the Shen guy and he started to deny what he told me, started being rude, until finally he agreed to send me a refund..... I called back to confirm the status of refund and this call center people kept putting me on hold, hanging up, one even lied that he wasnt on sit until they got tired of me calling and they transferred me to him and he was so rude and said he wasnt sending anything and then hung up...... I am so mad not because of the 200dollars but because the believe that can scam me of my hard earned money, charge my card with my authorization, canceled my flight and still bully me over it..... AND they are all the same, only india's worked there and they all are trained to lie..... SO stay away and if u mistakenly call the company like i did and get a call back hang up or record your calls with them... Pure indian scam company..... i pray they all get what they deserve.......",Negative

As if they were United, they instructed me to pay them $195 for the item.  When I figured out that they were not the airline, I told them not to charge me a dime.

3858,"Total Scam Beware! My husband had a last minute travel plan to SanFransico.He had United Airline travel credit which he intended to use to book the trip. When i googled for United Airline customer service  an add popped up for Fare Kingdom which looked exactly like United airline . Without realizing it was not the United Airline, i called them. They were smart enough not to say the name of their company. Instead they pretended like they were the United Customer service . They were pretty persistant about booking my husband's tickets. They said his credit with the airline had expired and they are letting him use for that one day out of courtesy and he cant use the credit if he doesnt book that day. Total Scam! We had lot of other things on mind and didnot think much.  The customer service agent booked the ticket and asked me to wait to hear for confirmation from him in half hour. I kept waiting. There is only 4 more hours for the flight . So I called them back and they said they havent booked the ticket because the fare went up! I asked them why I wasn't informed? And there was no answer! They called me multiple tines to book the ticket but wouldnt even bother to say that they couldnt! Such a waste of time! Luckily my husband found another airline and booked tickets with them. I really wanted to take time to post the review since, they pretend to be the airline customer service and they also made us believe that our airline  credit expired, even though it hadn't! Total scam! Beware of these companies!",Negative
3859,"I booked a flight from Dallas to Tampa for 245, but when I received my confirmation email, it stated that I was not confirmed. Shortly after I received another phone call from Fare kingdom saying that I need to pay an additional $77 dollars in order to confirm my spot with no refund offered if I wanted to cancel my flight. I was looking around for good deals, but in the end, I ended up paying more than competitors from a surprise charge saying that there was nothing they could do after I already bought the ticket. Buyers beware! In the end, they tried to blame me for ordering a non confirmed flight, but I looked over everything before I clicked submit. I was basically forced to either pay the $77 up-charge or loose my ticket and money. I am not happy. Even when calling in, they said that it was due to price increases that my ticket went up and they charged me more and the $77 was additional fees. I call that misleading, misdirecting, and theft.

Days turned into weeks as the hospital case worker was untangling the problems. Finally, they pitched the insurance company back to my daughter to resolve, who has no experience with this. And her husband was beginning to fail. I called my sister (at 9pm at night) who used to work for Angel Med Flight and she put me in touch with an Angel-agent who asked me three questions. In 6 hours, a fully equipped and medically staffed plane was at the Denver Airport, and an ambulance was transpirting my son in law from the hospital.

When I went to book the flight again it was going to cost me $40 more which I had already paid $60 the day before for an hour of the flight I was missing. When I asked if I could get the $40 refunded back to me, she said yes, but in a very confusing way that left me thinking my flight wouldn't be booked but I would get my hours refunded back to my account.

After two weeks of finishing the patch design they went into production (2-3 weeks) and then were shipped to my house (2 days). They came out great, however they were 3/4 inch too small. I ordered 4” circular patches and they came out too small. After brining this up they worked with me, gave me those patches free of charge, and immediately made the correct patches and express mailed them for next to nothing.

After three emails the main leg of our flights was confirmed but the name of one traveler was misspelled. Two months later we are still waiting for a correction without which we are refusing to travel since we could be bumped out of any leg of our flights. We also never received confirmation of our secondary flights. When reminding Paul last September, the travel assistant, he promised to follow up. Three weeks passed without any news. The only way out seems now to sue Foxflights. Given the above we can only strongly recommend to avoid Foxflights at all costs.",Postive

The condo was in fact still available for rent and she expedited everything.  She seemed just as excited as I was when she found out it was still available.  I would say that everything took about an hour.  Not only was it quick, they got me a lot cheaper deal than United Military Travel.

It took them over 4 months in order to get my plane tickets and I HAD to call them every day in order to make sure they didn't forget about me.

I had to cancel trip, book directly and loose most our money. They carged my account twice, misspelled my name snd got my DOB wrong.

Called them to inquiry about international tickets to the Philippines and was quoted from Ohio to Philippines with 2 stops cost $1700,which I thought was decent because if bought at different flight website like priceline, Travelocity, etc. it was about $1400. So I bought 2 international tickets for me and my aunt. After receiving the contract the price totaled to $5400. ??? Mine cost $2400 and my aunt cost $3000. Also, those people didn't put my married last name, even though I told them that my military id includes my married last name. This agent of theirs Mark Whittaker is full of iit. When their is problems with your ticket because of their mistake, they don't own up to it, instead they are extremely rude and will blame the customer instead. Called this mark guy and ask him if he works for absolute travel(company they use to book tickets, since they don't do it), he says yes. My husband tells him about the problem, then he says oh, I don't work for absolute travel, jumbling up his words then hang-up. Seriously??? Called the military travel and speak with Kristen about it and she was extremely rude, blaming me for their mistake and telling me I was invading privacy of their colleague, because I told her that my husband looked him up in Google to contact him about the ticket. How is that invasion of privacy when all your information about the company this mark Whittaker is presenting is accessible online in Google? Then she says that I was wrong because I gaved them the wrong name. Seriously???? All in all, please avoid doing business with them at all cost. Their interest is thru the roof as well.

I booked from US to Chennai through this fraud company and they booked it through Kuwait Airlines. We noticed the fee in Kuwait website as $1638.20 for 2 tickets.  However, due to website issue we went ahead and booked through this fraud company without knowing that they are fraud. I got the quote from them that i need to pay $1847 from this company and they said price fluctuates frequently.  We specifically asked if we need to pay anything as service fee for them. They said NO - No service fee included for this booking and it is only the ticket fee. We went ahead and booked. There were 2 transaction on my card. 1 for Kuwait airline for $1638.20 and 2nd transaction as AGENT FEE for $209. This company included AGENT FEE of $209 in ticket fee and  misrepresented the over-all ticket fee and charged $209 more than what is required for the ticket. We cross verified in KUWAIT Airline ticket and it is mentioned $819.10 for each ticket ( total $1638.20 for 2 ticket).  We called Kuwait airlines and they said they charged $1638.20 alone for 2 tickets and didn't charge anything else. This fraud company (Journey Cook) never explained where this $209 went and for what purpose.  The bank transaction details show this is AGENT FEE which they purposely hide it from us and cheated us.

4090,Primary Air rearranged my flight due to lacking a plane but only after I called them and waited two hours on the phone so that they change my flight from Birmingham to London Stansted.

They made us check out baggage (after we already paid extra to have cabin luggage) because it was 1 kilo more. We could have taken stuff out but there weren't working with us at all. Normally, you'd pay $50 or $60 to check your bag, we paid $120 to check a cabin bag! It was so overpriced. go with Ryanair or another budget company. If you're baggage fits their measurements, you're fine and if it's too heavy they let you check it for free at boarding.",Negative

So despite confirming they will compensate we are still waiting, many months down the line",Negative
4097,"Flight out to Newark made an 2 hour 'operational stop due to technical reasons' in Keflavik, Iceland.  Have since discovered it wasn't due to a transient fault, but because the airline cheaped out on buying planes.  Trustpilot doesn't allow links, so search the Independent newspaper's website for ""Budget airline promises 'nonstop' London to New York service on plane incapable of flying that far"" for proof. Apart from that, the seats were narrow, though they had ok legroom, and the meal was ok but bloody expensive for what it was (£21.99). On the journey back, however, departure was delayed by 2+hours.  We weren't warned by email, which staff claimed we should have been, unlike with the outbound 'operational stop'.  As this means we're departing close to 1:30am, the captain assures use that we'll not be disturbed until morning.  Staff then shook me awake after I'd fallen asleep to serve another overpriced meal! We land 3h late, which is too late to rebook my following connection, leaving me a further €110 out of pocket - negating any saving from using Primera Air in the first place. It's rare that I have nothing good to say about a company, but after one return flight they are my second least recommended airline (after Ryanair).",Negative
4098,This Airline needs closing down by the air authorities . The following thousands of awful reviews attest to the total lack of care and service from this company concerning delays and cancellations every other day .  There are just so many awful things wrong with how this airline operates. Do not travel with them under any circumstances,Negative
4099,"I don't normally take to review sites to voice my grievances about big companies, but am doing so because I really wouldn't want anyone else to experience the appalling service I've experienced from Primera Air. There is a very good reason why there are so many negative reviews here about Primera - PLEASE DO NOT MAKE A BOOKING WITH THEM. I travelled with Primera from Birmingham to Newark at the end of May and beginning of June: I live in the UK and my boyfriend lives in the US, so we only see each other every few months, and the journey can be exhausting and emotionally draining for us as it is. My flight to Newark was unobjectionable: the plane itself was tired and had seen better days and the whole flight was being chartered by an entirely different airline. I observed several passengers complaining to the cabin crew about their seats since they'd paid extra for seats with more leg room and had been given standard seats. The cabin crew were apologetic and explained that this was because Primera didn't have the newer fleet of planes they had expected to have, but basically the cabin crew didn't work for Primera and seemed unable to do anything to help. Apart from that, and the fact that the cabin crew forgot to give me the in-flight meal I had paid for and I had to ask about three times if I could be fed, the flight was tolerable and part of the cheap no-frills experience, I assumed. My flight home, on the other hand, was awful. When I arrived at Newark there was an immense crowd of people queuing at the Primera check-in desks. A number of Primera flights travelling from Newark 2nd June 2018 were severely delayed, and there was a lot of confusion around which flight passengers needed to check in first and at which desk. I think I waited close to an hour to check into my flight (side note: Primera also did not let you check-in online for flights to/from Birmingham or Newark and there were also no self check-in machines). When I got to the desk no one apologised, explained what was going on or offered vouchers for refreshment as I believe airlines operating in and out of the EU are legally obliged to do by EU rules. The experience at Newark airport itself was terrible, as the flight disruption meant that the airport changed the gate for my flight about five times in 4-5 hours I was stuck there and made everyone move - bear in that there were passengers there with very small children or who had limited mobility. No one seemed to know what was going on, and at one point one of the ground staff even mistakenly told passengers that our flight was cancelled. My flight was supposed to leave at 10pm, but by the time it boarded it was close to 3am and I was exhausted, and desperate to go to bed. When I got on board it was also one of the same worn-out old planes that I'd travelled on, and worse still it stank of urine from one of the adjacent toilets. The cabin crew were going around spraying air freshener, which was rather like putting a plaster on a shotgun wound considering the stench. The pilot explained over the PA system that the reason the flight was late was ""because we had to go and pick up some passengers from Stanstead"". As if this explained anything. Since I was so exhausted and decided to immediately try and get some sleep, I then missed the in-flight meal that I'd pay extra for. I arrived in Birmingham the next day close to 4 hours late, still exhausted. My boyfriend, who had booked a flight with Primera to come and see me in the UK in July, also got an email from them shortly afterwards saying they'd suddenly pulled the entire NYC - Birmingham route and that his booking was cancelled. When I got home, I submitted a request for compensation immediately. That was June, and I am still waiting for it. It took Primera Air 6 weeks to send any sort of response to my initial request - be aware that the claims team who deal with any compensation requests do not have a phone number because of ""legal requirements"" and you can only communicate with them by email. When they eventually replied, they got my details wrong and told me they would pay me €600 because my flight had been cancelled. When I replied saying that my flight had been delayed not cancelled, they suddenly backtracked on this and said they would pay €300. I've tried to question this a number of times, have gone back and forth with them via email waiting literally weeks between email responses, only to get robotic two line responses that don't answer any of my questions. I got so fed up of this that I asked if they could signpost me to their formal complaints process so I could make a complaint about their bad customer service; this has been completely ignored. Today was the absolute last straw as I checked my bank account and found that instead of paying me any compensation Primera Air had in fact CHARGED ME instead. I called their customer service team, and the lady I spoke to had no idea what was I talking about and again told me to email Primera as her team does not process compensation claims, saying she would let the claims team know about the charge. She apologised, but I felt like didn't really care about the fact that I'd had such a bad experience with Primera. She's probably heard it too many times, and in different languages. Consider this very lengthy review as fair warning that Primera may offer cheap flights, but clearly do not have the means or resources to run them properly. And when things go wrong - which they do with some regularity if the other reviews here are to go on - Primera really does not care about handling them quickly, competently or even empathetically.",Negative

4116,"Booked a return flight (PF41/PF42) for myself and my Daughter in November 2017 from Stanstead to Newark as the website stated that transatlantic flights are direct and are on a airbus with charging points for electronic devices. Two days before the outward flight I got a text to say that the flight was stopping at Iceland with no explanation as to why! I found out this was because they had changed the plane to a smaller aircraft (which did not have charging points) and therefore had to stop and refuel. This added an extra one and half hours to the arrival time at Newark which meant I had to change my transfer. On the way back I got a text the same morning as the return flight to say the flight would be again stopping at Iceland! Again it was a smaller aircraft. These planes are unsuitable for long haul and at no point were  we told the aircraft would be down graded or offered an opportunity for a refund due to the changes. I emailed customer service to complain about paying for a direct flight and not getting this and I was met with a rude reply telling me that as I know, they made a little refuelling stop and no one left the plane so no compensation was applicable. The meal was awful and not worth buying. My Daughter had a child’s meal and was told she could not have a bottle of water with this only tea or coffee. I will never fly with Primera Air again.",Negative

Never again I use this airline!,Negative
4118,"I was affected by the cancelled Birmingham-Newark flights in June. While I was still able to fly out from Birmingham, my return flight was cancelled. How did I find out that my flight had been cancelled? I read about it on BBC News. Despite claiming to have contacted affected customers, I received no communication whatsoever from Primera, so if I hadn't read that article I would have been stranded on my way back home. Having found out about the cancellation just two weeks before my holiday, I emailed Primera - I attempted to call them but could never get through on their very choppy phone line. After failing to hear back after a couple of days I rang them and managed to get through to a very rude customer service agent. The line was still extremely bad (and I know this was an issue on their end as I'd had the same issue when attempting to call them previously and had no other problems calling other people). While the lady I spoke to did rearrange our return flights so we were on the Stansted flight, the bad line made it very difficult to hear her and she became very snappy and irate with me when I had to ask her to repeat herself. There was no apology for the inconvenience caused by the cancellation; they just do not seem to care about their customers. No issues on the outbound flight, but the return one was delayed by half an hour for no apparent reason. The planes were not even Primera planes however, just another airline flying on their behalf. As we had to get a taxi back from Stansted to Birmingham, I emailed Primera to claim the cost back shortly after returning home (as instructed to do so by the airline). I received an auto reply saying it could take up to 30 working days to receive a reply and Primera made sure to stick with that deadline, replying on the 30th day exactly...to tell me to email an alternative address! Thankfully the other address I emailed did respond much faster, although I have now been told it could take four weeks to process. So despite having returned from holiday in June, I may not receive the money until October.... All in all I would not recommend this airline - there is an extreme lack of communication and awful customer service - both in terms of politeness and time taken to respond. I won't be using them again, and having read they have cancelled yet more flights they seem to be totally unreliable.",Negative

4120,"Disappointing 1st experience and will be last. 3 hour delay to Malaga from Birmingham on 22.08.18 due to a crew member not turning in and the only replacement needing to travel from Stanstead to Birmingham via TAXI!  7am departure due, 10am actual departure.  arriving 2 hours 45 minutes late into Malaga. Unorganised shambles at boarding gate.  Called passengers to board to then wait 30 minutes to be told to go back to lounge with an update at 8:30am, said update arrived at 8:45am with a update of ''next update at 10am'' .  This update then changed again 10 minutes later with ''boarding gate 49'', within 20 minutes (max) they were calling final call. Arrived at gate for the 2nd time, for them to load all passengers on 1 bus even though 2 were available.  resulting in 2 passengers only riding on the 2nd bus and a dangerously over crowded 1st bus. Then sat on the plane for 50 minutes whilst pilot informed us the crew member still hadn't arrived.  Safety demonstration rushed. I am not a nervous flight passenger at all, but to say the pilots turning manoeuvres during this flight were worrying is an understatement!!

I finally begged for a cup of tea which they gave me for free.  That is the only beverage that I had for 8 hrs.  When I asked again, please can I have water, they said no.

The question now why weren't we notified that he can't enter he would not have traveled the first time. The second issue is that now we have a minor a lone at the airport stranded there for two days just because of the airline mess up. We had to book a completely new flight to bring him back to Egypt.

My only main complaint is the leg-space in economy, it's a lot more narrow than other airlines. My bag that would usually slide perfectly underneath the aisle seat in front (ANA, KLM, Ryanair, Asiana, China Air) simply would not fit because the leg area had an inbuilt metal block in the way. My flight from Frankfurt to Tokyo was about 2 hours delayed so that wasn't great either. Other than that....the flights were alright, just uncomfortable compared to other economy seats. But I made it to Japan for a decent price, it was about £500. Last year I booked a trip to Incheon Seoul for this year mid October 2020. The pandemic doesn't look like it would end any time soon so I opted for the voucher to rebook at a later date. But then last month, I saw they had the money refund option available, so I decided I would go ahead and do that instead. I cancelled my booking on June-5th and received a full refund on July-21st.

4143,"Lufthansa cancelled the first part of a non-direct flight, allegedly due to the virus. The email about the cancellation was very unclear. It looked like they had just made small alterations to the other flight. I had to check my itinerary on the website to understand that the first flight didn't exist anymore. The ticket was now useless to me, so I cancelled the complete ticket and requested a refund via the website. They say that, if the ticket allows a refund, the refund will be credited to my card in a matter of days. Nowhere could I find information on whether my ticket allows a refund. Over a month later, I received an email with a receipt for the full value of my refund. But, weeks after that, I haven’t received any money yet.

4147,"Using Skyscanner and travel2be we had the choice between several airlines for my trip to Auckland... Alas we chose Swiss over a Chinese airline which was twice cheaper and had safe aircrafts because we thought that in case of any problem, we'd be safer. We were wrong. A ""priority service"" was automatically added and billed and I learnt that it was non refundable although the service was not provided since the june flight was obviously cancelled so that best case scenario only 85% of the flight ticket is refundable. As a French schoolboy, the month of june in seconde was the only time that was both convenient for the family that would welcome me and myself. Next year, I'll be in première, working for my bac de Français. We thus asked for a refund and travel2be and skyscanner told us they were powerless as Swiss ignored their emails. You'll have understood, we're pretty much disgusted with Swiss which is an airline totally devoid of empathy...The fact I was going at the other end of the world under very specific circumstances makes absolutely no difference (we cc ed them but to no avail) Qatar airways refunds in 7 days, BA and Finn air are pretty quick at refunding too, had my parents chosen the Chinese airline, they'd already had their refund and could have bought me a nice substitute gift (it was my birthday and Xmas gift) Don't make the same mistake !",Negative

They have begged the Swiss government for 1.4 billion francs, which they have and are still refusing to give refunds.

I booked last year 2 business class tickets from Cph to bkk Departure on 19/6 .. Last week on 16/5 I received an important information from a friend working in Bangkok that the civil aviation authority of Thailand have extended of temporary ban on all international flights to Thailand until 30 June 2020. I immediately contact Swiss by phone and by email to ask them if my flights were canceled of course. They been very rude and tell me that my flights were still confirmed! I also informed that on Swiss website my flights numbers don’t existed any more , they reply that because they are fully booked ! Which is a big lie I called Swiss few times regarding this issue, they still tell me in a very rude way that my flights are confirmed.. I just need to make sure that they will cancel my flights to organize another plan and to cancel all my hotel reservations.. They really don’t care . This situation is not acceptable and especially the bad way they treat costumers by phone that makes a really bad image of Swiss, hopefully I always Enjoyed the great service on board but by phone is a disaster!

After six weeks I called again an they told me that refunds are temporarely on hold Why do they lie every time, every one I had on the phone promised me yes you get your refund, but nothing happened I believe the review from another traveller that they wait untill august and hope they can give vouchers, but I don’t want a voucher off 4k, I want my money back, because of all this lies I never want to fly with them again So Swiss, give the people the refund, you just received 1.2  B from your gouvernment Maybe it's an idea to start a collective case as duped travelers to file for Swiss bankruptcy in connection with non-compliance with financial obligations, there are legal grounds for doing this, but you stand stronger with multiple creditors, because these are all duped travelers who need to get a refund. And I would like to start this just for the fact that Swiss as arrogant as they are, doesn't communicate back to you",Negative
4156,"If I could give this company 0 stars I would. The way they have handled the current climate has been abysmal. I have had to deal with about 8 companies about cancelled events and every single one of them has been absolutely brilliant except for Swiss Air. I had a flight booked for 28th April, and I rang on March 28th to try and get an answer of what would be happening. I was told I had 3 options: 1) Cancel the flight myself and receive only £50 refund per passenger, I explicitly told them this was not an option 2) Rebook using their new rebooking policy, again I told them this was n out an option and we cannot rebook within the available timeframe, not do we want to 3) In his exact words ‘Wait and see, we might cancel your flight ourselves’. I told him this process was disappointing but that would have to be our option. I am now due to fly tomorrow, and so I checked the website for flight information - There is no clear indication on any flights that have been cancelled. I have received no communications that my flight has been cancelled via email or otherwise. I then rang the company’s U.K. call centre, only to be told that the flight is no longer running, but more than that, that I myself had requested a cancellation previous to the flight being cancelled by Swiss Air. As stated above this was not the case, the agent I spoke to would not give me details on which staff member made the cancellation so that I could have it looked into, he would not pass me to a manager so that I could try and resolve the situation, and was completely unhelpful. The company is trying to cut me out of my £500 refund in any way possible, and I absolutely disgusted with the way it has been handled. I will never fly Swiss Air ever again, and I will do my absolute best to ensure that ANY person I know avoids this company too. I understand that these times are crazy for businesses, but ripping people off and fobbing off their questions and complaints in unacceptable.",Negative
4157,"Swiss Air refuses to process refunds for cancelled flights. Their standard reply on requests is that due to high volumes the process has been put on hold till further notice. See Twitter. First they tell you to call back in April, than May and now they say August! Now I know why.. I sent a complaint to  passengerrights @ bazl.admin.ch and this was their answer: ‘Discussions  are currently ongoing at European level as to whether vouchers can be issued instead of reimbursing the ticket costs. A modification of the Regulation is currently under discussion and Switzerland will adopt the new regime under the bilateral air services agreement as defined therein via the Joint Committee. Nevertheless, you can submit your complaint to FOCA. However, FOCA is currently suspending sanction proceedings regarding ticket cost reimbursement until further clarification of the legal situation at European level.’ So Swiss Air is delaying the process till the modification is official, so they don’t have to refund no more. Swiss Air: the tickets and cancellations (by you) took place while the EC261/2004 is still valid, so follow the law please and refund my/our money!",Negative

I have also still not received a reply on an email I sent 3 weeks ago. To think that for the amount of money you spend on the tickets you’d at least get decent service.

So with only two hours of picking different routes and dates, I put together a mini-Eurotrip under 200€ going through 6 cities. If you don't like flying too often, which I think I now don't, it would be better to stay in fever destinations for a longer time.",Postive
4202,"My experience with Eightydays was nothing short of amazing. I booked an eight location itinerary with them nine days before leaving for my trip. If you book farther in advance you can find some seriously amazing deals, but as I was booking somewhat last minute I was a bit more restricted with keeping costs down. So why did I use this service if not to get the lowest prices possible? Because it took some of the guesswork out of my last minute trip planning, as well as gave me the itinerary and all pricing in one place. Zero moving parts to add together. Things I liked about the interface/user experience -- ability to chose both origin + destination locations, ability to chose total number of destinations, the ability to change any suggested destination on the trip and see price increase/decrease for doing so, various methods of transport between locations (train, plane, etc), and the ability to select up to three ""must include"" locations. I was flexible with my trip route, but knew I wanted to go to Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. They made this possible. You can also select to add both a cabin bag and checked luggage to your reservation (for a fee) for the entire trip and know that is sorted in advance. Also, the price for adding luggage was very reasonable. What to expect after booking on the site: I received my confirmation straight away but still wondered if it was too good to be true. Spoiler alert: it is too good, but it is also very true. Next, I received a receipt, and after this, I received an email with the itinerary listing every flight/train. From start to finish this is one of the best customer service experiences I have ever had. Before every flight I would receive an email that I had been checked in for my flight -- my actual trip had 15 locations (some before + after this itinerary) so to say they saved me some massive stress by doing this would be an understatement. Some of these airlines REQUIRE prior check-in, and as a forgetful person who was on the go for over a month I'm certain I would have forgotten more than once. The other amazing thing about these check-in emails is it gives you the weight restrctions for the particular airline. In the US this is not as useful as it's somewhat standardized at 50lbs. However, in Europe, this information is very helpful -- especially for hand luggage/carryon. This service alone makes purchasing your flights through Eightydays worth it. There was a time when one of my flights had ""Mr."" rather than ""Ms."" listed on the check-in. I contacted the Eightydays staff and they immediately corrected it. They are seemingly always available through their facebook page. They also checked in on me a couple of times during the trip to remind me to contact them should I need recommendations etc. I was already very impressed with the service, but it was my next to last destination where they really came to my rescue. When I arrived at Vienna airport I was informed at check-in that my flight was canceled (without warning) and I would have to take a flight the following day. I contacted Eightydays about this and they immediately got to work on finding me another flight. I found this to be unbelievable. The airline itself offered zero assistance, yet Eightydays wasted no time in assisting me. Thanks to their amazing service I was able to suggest flights to other passengers who were likewise stranded. I was the only person on our flight who had assistance in sorting their flight -- to say I felt relieved would be an understatement. Booking through Eightydays felt like I had a travel fairy godmother. I never expected the service could truly be SO GOOD. I will admit at first I wondered if this site could be legitimate, because how could it possibly work that they do all of these amazing things, yet I had never heard of the service? I can happily say it is not only legitimate but one of the best experiences I have had working with any company.

4209,"Eightydays deserves an easy 5 stars. My boyfriend and I booked a 2 week trip to Stockholm, Berlin, Rome, and Barcelona a month and a half from our departure. The actual booking process was shockingly simple and they provided populated links to Airbnb searches for the cities and date ranges where you’ll be staying. That made the accommodation booking process super easy as well. After booking, I realized that I wanted to shift some dates and although that was not ideal, Eightydays was very kind and helpful (I recommend shifting the dates before booking). They also helped us add seat selections to our flights for the long ones in and out of Europe (we’re based in Oakland). All of the flights were direct and the boarding passes were emailed to me automatically (when possible, we had to check in for one airline). During the trip, Eightydays reached out to check in and ensure that everything was going well, and I truly could not be happier with their service. Eightydays does a great job of alleviating the stress of coordinating flights and dates, and let’s you focus on the more personal and pleasant parts of the process like where to stay and what to do on your trip.

After endless attempts to check in online (both from their website and the app), and after being told that “online check-in is not possible at the moment because of disrupted flights”, I was charged €76 for airport check-in for both my outbound and inbound flights. “There’s nothing to be done” I was told. And I was not the only one to suffer this carefully-planned Wizzair scheme to compensate for their current 30% operational capacity. There were other people in that same situation.  Of course I filed a complaint and... here is what I received: “Dear Customer, Thank you for contacting Wizz Air Customer Service Department. We would like to inform you that, Wizz Air do not do refund and cover fees for airport check in. I hope that, this answer is informative and helpful.” I wonder how many more people have fallen victims of this scam???",Negative

They will fly the plane meaning those of us that try and do the right thing are penalised. They would not refund, provide voucher or waive the change of flight charge. of £40.00. Other airlines with all their difficulties are more willing to help.

I would like to change a booking, which I can’t do by myself on the site, and use my voucher, but nobody answers the phone or reply on Whatsapp. The phoner number costs 0,50€ per minute and keeps toning. Even when they say “less than one minute”, nobody answers. Is it really this way customers must be treated?",Negative
4325,Terrible company. Non-existent customer service. Can’t respond to emails but can post numerous frustratingly cheesy rubbish Posts on their Facebook page. Refusal to refund cancelled flights and making up their own rules hiding behind “exceptional circumstances”. Other airlines I had booked with are also going through exceptional circumstances but acted in accordance with their terms and conditions for cancellations.  Worst airline I’ve ever had to deal with.,Negative
4326,"My wife and me flew from Amsterdam to Lisbon on June 8 - 2020. I understand that during the Corona pandemic Transavia had a very tough time and wants to safe the airline. However, the way they discard all rules and regulations set out by the Dutch government and the RIVM is not only irresponsible, but goes against all rules by the Dutch government. The flight was almost full, no empty seat between travelers. What is even more irresponsible is that they where serving food, which means that all passengers who bought the food had to take down there face masks. It is a flight of less the 3 hours, passengers can do without eating during such a short flight. Transavia be more responsible and don’t just think of making more money by serving food during this pandemic. My wife and me didn’t take our face masks of during the flight. People in the Netherlands get fined €390,= per person for not following the rules. Transavia should be held responsible if through there behavior people get sick or worse.",Negative

Other surprise: my reservation no. does not exist!!! Called several times, waited for an hour and got cut off twice. Apped to 2 different nos., but no reply. A great company. FOLLOW UP: today 10/6 my voucher was invalid! However, I paid € 268 for a flight, received a voucher, booked another flight with the voucher etc. read above. 2nd FOLLOW UP: since still no reply to apps and not able to reach them by phone (cut off after waiting for more than 1 hour), I decided to pay once more for the flight, since I needed to travel to Faro on 19/6.",Negative
4329,"We had booked to Mallora flying 19 June returning 23 June . according to Transavia our flights are still scheduled to fly even though under Spanish law no tourists are allowed (only 4 special cases of travellers may fly and we are not one of them) and once in Spain you would have to quarantine for 14 days - so how can we return within 5 and actually not even be allowed to travel? Transavia has written in the mail that we can rebook to travel before 31st March 2021 (which we don't want to do as the event for which we should have been there is no longer happening - cancelled not postponed) and that we will NOT be offered neither a voucher nor a refund - this is contravening Dutch law, Spanish law and EU regulations I have (at their recommendation) sent multiple whatsapps to the number with our details explaining the above and they do not respond, don't tray calling as you can be on hold for an hour or more, and if you want an email response they will get back to you 'within 3 months !! - this is a horrible situation for many people and I feel sorry for anyone involved in the hospitality/travel trade but breaking the law is just plain disgusting",Negative

But I cannot say the same for their mother company, Air France.",Postive
4331,"Utterly unspeakable. They have refused a refund for a cancelled flight despite a score of emails, and even admitting that they are breaking EU law. Now, despite an instruction from the Dutch Director of Civil Aviation, they are still refusing and trying to take refuge in ""extraordinary circumstances"" and continue their attempts to bully me into accepting a voucher. (EC 261 exceptions apply to compensation, not refunds). Perhaps a joint action against them would be appropriate, also now requiring compensation for their intransigence. Their behaviour should certainly be widely publicised on social media. Never, ever, choose to travel with them.",Negative

While I was contucting them by phone call to ask for my refund, the customer service call was cost me 20 euros for 8 minutes talk. This is again against the EU laws and it violates my consumer rights. I dont have money to travel to my desination and they offer me alternative flights tto travel from Brussels airport.

4337,"So I'm joining the army of people who this airline are treating with contempt regarding refunds for cancelled flights. Their behaviour is nothing short of theft given the service paid for was not provided and they are legally obliged to refund their customers. In summary a flight was booked to Cyprus which was cancelled. The e mail said my money would be refunded and not being an unreasonable person I waited one month before following it up when I was informed it would be coming. After another three weeks I e mailed them again and received a reply saying they were not now responding to e mails and that a response would take up to three months! This is outrageous behaviour. I've written before how easy it is for companies to take money from our credit cards! Unfortunately, the system does not work so efficiently when they need to refund a customers money. The current crisis will change the future of airline travel and I would encourage readers to vote with their feet (and their money) and avoid this airline. Not that they will probably care!",Negative

Apparently the borders closed after I booked the ticket and Transavia never alerted us, nor did they mention the change when I checked in for my flight the next day. I traveled in good faith, believing the airline to follow and be aware of current visa and border restrictions. Unfortunately, they did not. I was detained in Holland, booked and fingerprinted, transported in police van to Amsterdam and informed that Transavia would take no responsibility for the issue. I had to book a last minute ticket to the US, endangering my loved ones, as I have no residence in the USA. When I complained to customer service they informed me that they deny and responsibility but that is not what border security told me. Avoid this company!!!",Negative

The accounts department says they got the refund from the carrier, but they never credited the money back to my account. It’s been 3 months now, and they just want to steal my money.

They are extremely professional and offer a pleasurable experience to the customers in every situation. Unfortunately two out of three times that we booked through them, there were extraordinary circumstances - once a death in the family and then next time Corona virus situation - both times we had  ""cancel / rebook / re-cancel / re-rebook"" type of situations. There were a couple of less than professional reps that I had to deal with over phone, but I would not blame them. The situations were demanding and they were trying their best to serve everyone. I would like to give a big shout out to Ravish and Victor (Vikram), who worked relentlessly to get us the best of the best options. They were never ever tired of our constant questions, no frustration in their voice, no rush to finish off the discussion - they always had a listening ear. They stayed with me until I got the last dollar back, even after the journey was over. Service was simply extraordinary. I wish this company the best success ever in the travel industry.

After a while he presented me with several options by email as I wanted to have time to compare my flight. Luke Gordon did a great job, not only was my flight more convenient and most importantly much cheaper ( by about $600 ) Also my luggage was forwarded to my final destination. Thank you again Luke for a job well done.  Keep it up and you will go places. Best wishes for a bright future. Manfred Jacob",Postive

Her name is Au  Rodil she's  the branch manager  of San Jose. Though  I  bought  the tickets  in Vallejo.  The first  cancellation  I was lucky  to have her to work  on the rebooking.

The renewal did not happen several months ago: It happened last month and was posted to a credit card this month. I was fine trying the service for a year.

I called again to ask where is the driver, the dispatcher did not know and had to look for him. I waited a long time(over 30 minutes).

4842,"We choose Park Ride Fly USA for our flight in and out of Boston. Parking was available through Rodeway Inn Airport Parking in Revere, MA. When we arrived there was confusion about where to park at the sight and help was only available inside the building. When we went inside we were given paperwork to fill out and while filling out the paperwork the only employee left to go take a smoke break. When the paperwork was completed we were told to wait for the shuttle which was running behind according to the employee. After waiting 30 minutes we were concerned about missing our flight so told the employee we were doing to call an Uber. That is when we discovered that the parking was not onsite but that we were expected to follow the shuttle to drive to a different location to park our car and then get on the shuttle. In speaking with the employee we were able to make arrangements to leave our car on site and have them move it later. When we reterned we reached out for the shuttle to pick us up at the airport. The shuttle ride and drive were good. The shuttle driver was told our car was at the off site location. We were taken there and after the shuttle driver spoke to an employee on site it was found that our car was not at that location. So we got back in the shuttle and then was taken back to the original location were our car was located. Overall there seemed to be little organization or system. Employees seemed to not know what was going and it was frustrating that we had to spend each money to get to the airport and that we had to spend extra time on the way home to drive around and locate our car.",Postive

Struggling to get the dispute re-filed with Citibank, so their star rating isn't stacking up so well either.  I *thought* I was being a good person by giving Skybooker a chance to right their wrong, but now they are just a band of liars and thieves.  Meanwhile, I'm out $1,243.",Negative
4932,Airline cancelled flight and not given full refund. Partial refund offer has decreased over time with no explanation,Negative
4933,"Just adding another bad review. We called the airline company directly and were told that they never received a payment from skybooker for our reservation so they won't be able to refund us. Also, the airline never cancelled the flight, it's still scheduled. Skybooker cancelled it!! And never informed us about the cancellation either, I found out by randomly checking online. Skybooker said they requested money back from the airline (that they never paid) and waiting time was up to 5 months and they would keep 1100 for service fees, credit card charges and other fees. What other fees? How come that breakdown was never given before when the receipt was issued? Anyways... we are trying to get the money back through our credit card company. There must be some legal stuff that can be done against this company?!?",Negative
4934,"DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT BOOK WITH THIS SITE.  I booked a trip during covid and absolutely no way to contact this merchant to get a refund or reschedule.   THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE. DO NOT USE THIS SITE!!!",Negative
4935,Where is the zero star option?! NEVER book with this company!! Total lack of transparency about service fees and what they call credit card fees. Just lost close to $900 to them. I decided to take a refund because I dont believe this fraudulent company will be around in a year so a voucher will be useless. Got quoted a refund total and they didnt even honor that and issued a lower amount. Shame on you!,Negative
4936,"I would give them zero stars! Absolutely terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible! We were scheduled to go to Italy for our daughter's graduation and Skybooker cancelled our trip. Since the graduation has come and gone we asked for a refund. Rather than give us a refund they want to keep 2400.00 for fees and taxes. Taxes and fees for what? IT WAS CANCELLED BY YOU!!!!!! NEVER use these people!!!!!",Negative
4937,"I had terrible customer service. My overseas tour was cancelled by the country of Austria due to COVID-19. When I contacted Skybooker they advised me to wait until the airlines cancelled my plane tickets and then request a refund. I did EXACTLY as they told me. Instead of giving me a refund they re-booked different plane tickets. I also bought travle insurance that was a joke. I will NEVER recommend Skybooker, or use this service again. The US Department of Transportation had on their website............that if airplane tickets are cancelled BY THE AIRLINES.......that a refund is due EVEN IF THEY WERE NON-REFUNABLE tickets. Disappointed for sure!",Negative

Very disappointed and will never use them again.  During coronavirus, they should be forgiving of service fees.  Not happy.",Negative
4940,"We purchased three tickets through skybooker/airfareexperts.com. The flights were confirmed online prior to arriving at the orlando international airport. When my family arrived dispite having the tickets for an international flight. No flight desk/checkin personnel for the airline were posted or showed up. The airport information personnel were also puzzled how we had an itinerary and a confirmation but no flight scheduled to depart. The one thing they were positive; that airline was not flying out of orlando international that day. The flight number was traced to a domestic flight four days earlier which did not match our itinerary or our confirmation. The airport had no international flights going out, At this point, my family was stranded. This delima ensued more cost. When I called skybooker they wanted to charge me 50$ per ticket in order to refund them ($150 in total). The employee stated, I was entitled to a full refund and did I want him to go ahead with it so that my family would not show in the system as a ""no show"". I later called during posted business hours to request the full refund (to include the $150) but the automated system is saying they were closed. I'll try again next week before consulting my legal advisor. I have since had to purchase over $4000 in tickets through a different airline to get my family home. Covid is not an excuse for egregious business practices. If asked, to setup a flight and your paid you to do so then I expect your full effort to ensure you do what your hired to do. If your coordinateing flights I expect you to know, the airport has not flown internationally for the past several months.",Negative
4941,"Would not offer full refund during COVID even though the actual airlines was offering a full refund. Skybooker was requesting to get their ""service fee"" which was over $600. Beware of using them to book your flight with, they will not have your back if anything goes wrong. I will be letting everyone I know not to book using sky booker as they are completely unwilling to help",Negative
4942,Our original itinerary has been changed a couple of times. Our return flight has also been canceled. We are not even aware what our current itinerary flights are. As we ourselves have not canceled or requested a change in our flights we do not think it fair to receive only a partial refund. As a service is not being provided for us we do not see a reason why these service fees should be held. No one is aware of what future flight travel looks like so it is highly unfair to ask people to take a travel credit that are not comfortable with that option. Terrible and horrendous service.,Postive
4943,"I asked for a full refund since my flight was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic and they kept around $500 as a non-refundable service fee on our tickets. It is a difficult time, but that is stealing. We will not be using them again.",Negative
4944,"Skybooker cancelled my flights and then refused to give refunds. I had multiple friends who got refunds and skybooker claimed these were all accidents. I was even told at one point over the phone that I would be getting a refund that would be in my account in 10-15 days. When I called back after 20 days they pretended like that was yet another accident. Have still received no refund, got stuck in a loop of them saying they'll call me back and never received a reply to my last email. A quick Google of ""airlines required to give refunds dot"" will show the governments opinion. I.e. refunds are required if the flight is cancelled. Edit after first response: I simply asked if it was possible to cancel and get a refund, did not request cancellation. I requested more information. I've received several different numbers for refund amounts, credits, etc... First a 769.61 future credit, then a 909.61 future credit, now a 344.61 partial refund that I don't have email record of. I have an automated email confirming my email on the 22nd of march, then the next email is April 11th saying my flights are cancelled. TLDR: Told me I'd get a $769.61 refund over the phone, never got a refund. Refunded my friends that amount, said it was airline accident.",Negative
4945,"They cancelled my flight reservation without me asking them to. In addition to cancelling my flight, they said that because the flight was still scheduled by the airline the ""airline"" would not give a full refund.

4946,I have been trying for weeks to get ahold of skybooker with the only # I can find 1-888-591-5929. I'm either hung up on or it goes to an email. Part of my flights have been canceled due to Covid19 and I'm just sitting here in limbo while the flight date approaches. Does anyone have a phone # that actually goes to a live person? My review would be better if I could get ahold of someone.,Negative
4947,The Skybooker.com travel agency charges exorbitant services charges even when flights are cancelled. The Skybooker withholds around 25% of the airfare for the refunds for their “service fees and credit card charges”. The airlines reimburse Skybooker fully for the cancelled flights though. This price gouging practice is totally opportunistic and unfair and they are taking advantage of the helpless customers especially during these difficult times due to COVID-19. This operation seems to be mostly run from India with low labor costs so it is hard to imagine such enormous service charges. Our multiple inquires requesting to itemize and to justify all their services charges and fees in detail were unsuccessful. This practice (of nondisclosure of itemized fees upfront) appears to be a clever scheme to allow maximum maneuverability to hit the customers with exorbitant service fees when things go wrong. Their service reps are not knowledgeable and are unhelpful.,Negative
4948,"My experiences were similar to those outlined in the other reviews The airline cancelled my flight in Feb due to COVID and gave Skybookers a full refund. Skybookers did not tell me and still insists I need to ""cancel"" my booking or lose the fare They are offering $3100 in refund or $3700 (what I paid) in credit You can lodge a formal complaint with US DOT When my CC company opens tomorrow I'll be calling this in as fraudulent Go to this website and follow instructions www  transportation.gov /individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/refunds",Negative

I have called 25 times (no exaggeration) and every time they say call them back later or they can only give me credit.  Swiss airlines has confirmed 4 times to me that I am due a refund but exploretrip refuses to call them to get the voucher code. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!! I promise you other companies are way better. Never knew I would have to jump through so many hoops to get a refund on a flight canceled by an airline. I hope Explore Trip learns from this and helps their customers more.

They said it is because airlines change day by day. Since I have first time experience, I said $3200, otherwise I will keep the tickets. They comeback said refund $3000. I said no. $3200, if no I will keep the tickets, you get nothing. He finally came back to me and accepted. I am still waiting for the money.

Due to COVID-19 all international flights are canceled to Istanbul which is including the flights from USA. The flight was officially canceled over a week ago by the airline company. I have reached out to the customer service which is a REAL JOKE!! They have waited me over 1 hour and hung up on me over 4 times!! First they told me that I can get the refund with $450 of penalty due to non-refundable taxes, after I shared with them my knowledge on the purchasing details and the announcement of the Department of Transportation which states that if a flight is canceled for any reason the passenger is entitled to a full refund, they offered me to pay $350. We had 4 times back and forth conversation and finally they asked me to only refund the ticket price with $50 of penalty. Even though I talked to the airline company and they confirmed me that the full refund should be given to me ExploreTrip is still trying to get $50 of penalty from me. I have been on the phone with them for over 2 hours and whenever they have no response they basically hang up on me. I have shared with them that they are violating The Department of Transportation flight policies. If the Department of Transportation policies are not followed then how they are allowed to operate in the United States?? I am in the process of reporting to FTC. This is the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I’ve ever had!. I wish I was getting my ticket from flight provider directly. I understand all the problems of travel sector is going through during this time however this company is NOT doing the RIGHT thing. I will never book with them again.

4972,"My second review of ExploreTrip Scammers. Im writing with the same matter, those guys still owe me more than $600 for cancelled flight and after 10 weeks of fighting with them straight and through my Visa fraud department on other side, nothing changed yet. I understand, that this is difficult time even for air companies, but for the parasitic companies like ExploreTrip- its disaster. Still, Im as a client should be covered with protection plan, which they promised, upon buying a tickets from this Scammers. The interesting fact, that I contact Airlines directly, and of cause they didn't refund me anything, but said, that they offered credit for my particular flight after 7 days that was cancelled. And ExploreTrip 100% informed about that, and received it, but they never offer me or other clients any of credit options. That means, I insist they are SCAMMERS, of course some of their flights happened, but in general- their company interests in much higher priority, than their clients.

I spoke to a Nadal, 1st off he had so much background noise it was difficult to hear him. He spoke over me while I was asking questions, He continued to sigh on the phone when I asked him to stop sighing when I was talking, and whenever I asked to speak with a supervisor/manager he would deflect off it and talk about totally something different. Now, I am the customer right? Why the hell are you sighing on the phone and yelling at your customer!! Granted I became frustrated and got loud back BUT since he was getting loud with me and yelling I became defensive. Also, you would think this travel agency would accommodate their customers in our difficult times - but no. No it’s back to normal business with even though this Nadal agent said we are in a ‘pandemic’. TO ANYONE WHO IS READING >>>>>> DO NOT USE EXPLORE TRIP!!! I REPEAT >>>>>> DO NOT USE EXPLORE TRIP to book!!! They are extremely rude in all aspects I don’t even know how they are still in business!!!

They say I have to pay a penalty fee and some other fee but the airline isn't even charging penalty fees for their customers. The agency said, ""If I feel safe, I can just travel"". Excuse me? It's like they want me to get CO-VID. This is the WORSE travel agency because they are so inconsiderate of what is happening today and isn't helping out with my families tickets to rebook. Our original price for our tickets were $500 for July. JULY! Which is more expensive than September!! They're telling me the difference pricing for flights would be an additional $300.

When trying to have the e-mail resent from their website, I was unable to log in or sign up for a My Bravofly account - hence, I could not get my booking reference/ID. - Trying to reach customer service is a dead end. When telephoning the number provided by the website, one is ultimately hung up on. Additionally, no responsive e-mail address is provided. As a last resort, I opted for writing them through their Facebook page, but due to Covid-19 circumstances they have chosen not to respond via Facebook. - This would be very understandable, if other methods of contacting customer service was actually attainable. - When I was finally able to achieve my booking reference/ID, (After my flight had been changed by them, and I had thereby been sent an e-mail) no information regarding rebooking of the flight was available.

My flight was canceled and borders shut. I was informed that a 'refund' would be forthcoming -- at a considerably lower amount. I am still waiting at 4+ months.

However, since I booked through kiwi, I have to get the refund from them. If you don’t pay extra they won’t help you. I finally got ahold of the email. I gave them all the details of the refund. It’s been months. They are avoiding my emails. It is against their own return policy and is fraudulent. Do not trust this company. They are not there for you if anything happens and flat out steal your money.",Negative
5001,"They refuse to give a refund for a flight that was canceled due to COVID-19. Honestly, it's embarring that a company like that is still in business. It's been more than three months since I requested a refund. I might need to sue them to get my money back. It's alarming how little protection consumers have in the United States.",Negative
5002,"I am very surprise, people still work for this company. I would not be able to cheat customers and destroy others life for money. Go and sell drugs on the street...its the same. Or rather contribute something to the sociaty..",Negative
5003,I would give them a ZERO if i could.  They refused to refund my cancelled flights that were cancelled as a part of COVID and said I should reach out to the airline.  The problem is Kiwi.com booked and paid for the flight with the airline with their credit card and info and the airline tells me to goto Kiwi.com so basically I am OUT of my money and pissed off!!,Negative
5004,SCAMMERS. Do not fly. I paid a compensation fee and an extra processing fee for my cancelled flights in April. They offered my half of my money back but in credit. No way. I paid extra for a processing fee and waited. It's now July and still no money back in my account. Customer help line rings off and my emails bounced.,Negative
5005,"Absolutely horrible. I put in a refund request in April, followed up in June and was told one was not completed so I filled another one on the phone with a customer service agent. When I called today to follow up I was told AGAIN that one was not completed. This company is a complete SCAM.",Negative
5006,"Kiwi always proves to be one of the worst I have came across during travels. The first problem was when the horrible  Rayanair rescheduled my outbound  trip to became 16 hours after it was 4 hours . After headaches and complaining and writing reviews all over the net They refund me that part  then I rebooked directly with EasyJet. Then covid 19 started so both trip with kiwi and EasyJet were cancelled. EasyJet offer me  choice a voucher with extra free credit or full refund which I chose and they did refund fast in full yes in full unlike kiwi. Kiwi and The horrible Rayanair  after two months of waiting They sent me  a voucher which is not the full money I paid to kiwi for that part of trip. I rejected the voucher and I am not able to call kiwi to complain because they removed their phone number to frustrate the customers  and force them to abandon their money. The lesson I learned is never book throw company like kiwi , never go to Rayanair because they will ruin your trip . Chose a well reputable carrier you might pay little money extra but you will have peace of mind. Now My money is gone between Rayanair and Kiwi. We are still in Covid pandemic cancellations will be expected if you chose those companies you lose a lot of money.",Negative
5007,You failed to handle the COVID cancellations responsibly. Found out 4 months after requesting a refund that you set my trip as non-refundable and didn't update me at all. Airlines offered full refunds for the flights cancelled on my trip + I payed you the assisted refund fee. You've taken more money from people to act as a middle-man and didn't even process the refunds that the airlines were already offering.,Negative
5008,"Do not ever book via Kiwi, they are seriously dodgy! They tend to provide invoices where they mix up the details between passengers, add a sham email in the ticket vouchers (@andrejbabisfanpage.com), their own credit card details and no other information required by the airlines! I am unable to cash any vouchers from the Corona cancellations because of this. Lost all the tickets! Obviously there is no phone number or email to contact them!",Negative
5009,"Avoid at all costs. DO NOT book with this company? How are they allowed to keep operating? Probably one of the worst experiences I've ever had with an airline company. Booked a return connection flight with one connection, paying £800+ the second part of the connection flight got cancelled and I was told I have to pay an extra £230 for an alternative connection fight which would require me to wait 19 hours in the airport! There were plenty of other options on skyscanner and booking.com I asked for a refund, I was then given three options, wait 6 months for full refund(which was not guaranteed after checking reviews) or Most of my money after three months (again was not honoured after reading reviews) or an instant refund which was £90. So now we are stuck with 3 flights and one bad connection, with our only option to book another flight, as they do not refund on single connections, and won't give the details for the booking so we can contact them directly. Never book with this company they are a complete scam and money stealing company. How they are allowed to trade is beyond me, the government has to fine this company and bring them to a halt.",Negative
5010,Scammers and thieves!!!! Flight was cancelled and won’t give me a refund.,Negative
5011,"Never book through kiwi.com! Always direct with the airline!! Kiwi charge extortionate administration/handling fees (which they hide in the booking process) that they claim are non refundable! If anything happens you lose a significant amount of money (that is, if they even refund anything)! Don't risk it! Just look at the number of complaints, they're terrible!",Negative
5012,"This is truly an awful company that makes its money only by charging you fees. It's classic ""gotcha predatory capitalism"" and ""you should have read the fine print"". They have a 36 hour cut-off window (prior to your flight) where you need to enter all passenger information for Ryanair and request all baggage and extras. Otherwise, you're stuck and you've missed check-in and add-ons. So, have fun with the extra bills for late check-in and otherwise. If you are good at reading all of the fine print for their emails and planning your check in times down to the hour and narrow time window needed to complete everything, then great this company is for you but if you are a regular traveler who is used to an at least 24 hour check in window, then you should really look elsewhere and book directly with the airline.",Negative
5013,Would really recommend to anyone not to use Kiwi.com. Been dealing with them re refunds over flights cancelled due to covid-19. They offered us two options: - Kiwi.com credits valid for a year (useless at the moment) - An assisted refund for which they charge £20 We opted for the second of these and were advised we should wait 6 weeks for a full monetary refund. 5 months later and we have been seriously let down. Numerous calls and emails have been made and so far we have received a voucher for a seemingly random amount of money which is less than half the money that the flights cost. Customer service have been pretty rude on the phone and very unhelpful. This is a deeply untrustworthy company. Stay well away.,Negative
5014,DO NOT USE KIWI.COM I have been waiting for over 4 months for my money back after our trip to Italy was cancelled. you are better off booking direct with the airlines themselves looks like there are fake reviews on here giving them 5 stars as well which they do not deserve.,Negative
5015,"What a mess No option to contact them at all, if you haven't paid for the privilege in advance. They won't forward emails from airlines as they promised while allowing to chase airlines for refunds, won't hand over credentials from email accounts they generated to do bookings on your behalf... I'm pretty much lost my money directly because of Kiwi",Negative
5016,Keeping my money. No help at all.,Negative
5017,"Around five hundred pounds are still pending for a refund to me over four months on a self-transferred round-trip sold by Kiwi, although I paid extra fee for ""refund assistant"" to the European Czech company. I got future travel ticket from the carrier BA earlier, which ""kind of"" makes up the other five hundred pounds I paid to Kiwi. Nothing ever miraculously happenned until I contacted them, regardless the ""assisted refund"". The flight was cancelled by a Chinese carrier, and the carrier told us they already refunded to them half a month ago. No updated news from the flight booking company. What happened? Where is my refund?",Negative
5018,"This travel agency is a scam, please warn all your friends, families, love ones even stranger NOT TO PURCHASE FROM THEM!

My dissatisfaction is, I called once i found out the flights were cancelled and was told that I was getting my refund in 2 to 3 weeks. Five weeks have gone by and no refund, so I called a couple of days ago and was told to be able to request a refund I had to pay a fee of $35.00. I actually had to explain to the support person that I was requesting my WHOLE refund, since he told me I was getting refunded just for my outbound flight, since the inbound was not cancelled. Are you kidding me? If I didn't take the flight OUT, how would I have taken the returning one? I did pay, otherwise felt I was going to have to fight them with my credit card company to get a chargeback. I will not use this service again.",Negative

5091,Had my original flights cancelled and rescheduled to alternative dates in early-June despite Brussels Airlines knowing the new dates would be cancelled. Now unreachable on the phone; I've spent more than 20 hours trying to get through to them on their customer service phone line without success. There's no option to email them or request a refund online and their social media channels don't respond or just direct back to the customer service phone line. Emails to the CEO of Brussels Airlines and latterly to the CEO of Lufthansa (who owns Brussels Airlines) have both gone unanswered. It might only be 200 euros I'm trying to have refunded but it is ridiculous Brussels Airlines can hold onto my money while making it nigh on impossible to contact them in return. They were quick enough to take my money and book me onto non-existent flights twice; they should have the courtesy to respond in kind and refund mine and other peoples' money without delay.,Negative
5092,They have not refunded my cancelled flight in more than 2 months.  It's outrageous.  When you call customer service they are utterly useless and tell you that you are on a list for a refund.

On the second call, when I understood that the earlier flight does not work for me, I was told by operator that: a) free cancelation is not possible (at least 70 euro charge, but no exact amount data) b) it is not granted that the money for the extra luggage payed (260 euro) to the other air company will be refunded, as usually it is not what they do How can customer service be so misleading? And how can you not provide the amount of luggage I have payed for, when you are the ones canceling the flight? _______ UPDATE: I got full refund 5 days after cancelling my flight, which I am very happy with, thank you. Still those questions above regarding the luggage payed/provided and controversy information given by call-service operator remain open, therefore 2 stars.",Negative

You can only change a flight that was canceled up to 3 hours!!!! The second alternative I had to pay 171€ the double I paid for the inicial ticket.

Only reason it isn't a 1-Star is that they booked the substitute flight directly for us so we only have to claim back hotel and taxi costs.

Michele was able to get excellent prices, she put together a perfect itinerary for what I wanted, and she handled the logistcs of the all the bookings efficiently.   I was impressed not only with Michele's skills as a travel agent, which are outstanding, but her attitude. The most impressive part of her performance was her response when she was faced with a difficult challenge. For my trip to India, she had to deal with some very complicated booking problems which were the result of a mistake I had made.. Her handling this situation which I had set into motion, required several hours of going back and forth with several airlines, and continuing to stay in touch with me as well. She never lost her composure or blamed me for the problem which I had created. Throughout the difficulties in completing the transaction, she was supportive and genuinely good natured. Plus, in order to help me get out of the tangle I had created, she ended up working at odd hours. Through it all, she was impressively efficient.

5145,Hi. I booked a flight with TURKISH AIRLINES through SKYSCANNER. They had lots of flights to choose from. I booked July 10 2020. Paid my money received booking through email. Then few days later said they have cancelled my flight. Due to COVID 19 .We all know about C 19. So why are they still selling flights knowing they have no intentions of Flying. No alternative flights offered. I think this is a SCAM.,Negative

According to the regulation No. 261/2004, in the event of the cancellation, the passengers concerned must be offered reimbursement of the costs of the tickets. However, the airline proposed to me only to suspend the ticket without paying any fee. This solution is not acceptable for me, as this journey was a one time decision and we do not plan to travel to Turkey in the nearest future. As I see now, I'm one of the thousands passengers  screwed up by this airline. I would suggest people to avoid flying with Turkish Airlines!",Negative

Just to get all the details right. I assume that you will pay for my ticket to the airport from my home town and back again as it is your requirement that i have to meet up in the airport in person. Alternatively i suggest using a bank transfer to my account with the total amount in danish crowns. I know for a fact that other airlines are doing this.

5148,"Dear Turkish Airline, I am writing this email to report an issue for the voucher application of the cancelled flight: TWG3LX. My flight to Guangzhou China from Dublin is rescheduled again and again from April to May and now to 10 June. Firstly, I email your call center in May and ask them to cancel my booking because it keeps suspended. Then your email reply to me saying that the my booking is cancelled. Secondly, right before the flight date, I have already double checked the booking TWG3LX in my apps, no boarding online is available, which means the flight is cancelled before 10 June 2020. Thirdly, call center help me to check the flight on 10 & 11 June 2020. The flight route TK072 from Istanbul to Guangzhou is either suspended or cancelled. So it means it is not possible for me to fly the flight if I don't cancel the booking. However, now when I am going to apply the voucher (not refund, as I think voucher would be easier to get), I was told that my flight is in order and not cancelled. So I can not get refund or voucher. This is totally your customer service's mistake. But no matter how I contact your sale center by phone or by email (your ireland sale center) or by your feedback form. Your answer is just simply rejection to my refund request, even I provide you the correspondence showing your sale center cancel my booking. No choice, I have to report the issue here in your fb page and urge you to seriously look into my case and grant me either voucher or refund. Thank you and well regards,",Negative

I have given only voucher option instead of a full refund to use until at the end of the year. Vaucher value for %15 £ extra on top of what I paid for cancelled flight !.Seams not bad in fist  But Than  When I decided to rebook for the new flight ( of course I have no option this time because they tie me with the voucher to be used only for rebooking from the Turkish airlines). So still not bad until you noticed the prices go up even the British Airways flying  £20.00 Cheaper from my popular area of  London Heathrow. So worst is coming after  I just wanted to rebook and get over but it is not possible IT IS IMPOSSIBLE!.. , Because there is no voucher option showing in next to my purchase area You can just pay full and they will happily accept your other payment. No boxes to put the reference for the cancelled flight and refunded voucher. Spend hours call so many numbers they all go to the same call centre .and I sent 6 different emails 5 of them back because their message boxes are full.  I call them again nobody understands they all agreed I can only solve the problem by going to the sale office. But even the most closed one in Birmingham a minimum of 3 hours all the other 3 offices are more distance I live in S.wales  London-Birmingham- Manchester and Edinburgh. BUT MORE SHOCKING CALL CENTRE SAYS; THEY ARE CLOSED THEY WORK BY EMAIL BUT EMAILS TAKES MINIMUM ONE WEEK TO REPLAY,  MY RESERVATION FEES OF £ 16.00 GBP I PAID EXTRA IS GOING TO BE LOST BECAUSE IS ONLY 3 DAYS GIVEN BECAUSE I CAN NOT SOLVE THIS VOUCHER ISSUE  £221.81 GBP IN 3 DAYS ALSO I WILL LOSE IT. ACTUALLY MY VOUCHER VALUE and  £16.00 GBP makes ALREADY MORE THEN MY REBOOKING VALUE BUT I CAN NOT GET THAT TICKET BEFORE THEY CONFIRM SO THAT WON'T BE POSSIBLE. THIS OUTRAGE UNACCEPTABLE SYSTEM.   I made so many calls but still, I have NO NUMBER TO CONTACT AND SOLVE THE PROBLEM. MY LAST CALL HAS BEING CUT OFF 20 MINUTES AFTER WITHOUT EVEN GET ANY CONTACT NUMBER FROM THEM. You must do these if you want to be a good service provider; 1-If a person purchased their tickets online meaning is a reason for it it could be plenty of other reason. So this person could be able to all other necessary things online only. They must not be involving any tickets office. 2-If a person buy their tickets from London or England don't send them turkish tickets office telephone number in Turkey . That is stupid. 3 -If the flight is cancelled by airways refund in full or you can give an option only some people may agree with.Because in Europe lots peoples work for some other companies so if you cancel or changes their flight schedule they may not be available for any other your available dates. Return their full refund back 4- If a person paid by a credit card or debit card do all the refund to the same card or you can ask an option but don't ask them to pay you by BANK TRANSFER!  SOMETIMES MAY HAPPEN SOME PRICE DIFFERENT WHEN THEY REBOOKING. iT IS A QUITE COMPLEX PAYMENT MEDHODE NOT EASLY CAN DO MOST OF THE TIME USE THE SAME CARD. 5- If you offer them a VOUCHER that stupid voucher easily be converted to the same currency when they rebooking it they must not ring the ticket office or some other useless area.

I woyuld have given you only one star but I am giving you two stars because of earlier experiences. Those times no problems with company or flights and nice service. But now you are playing with the most important reason to choose a flight company. And that is trust. 26th March your customer service promised me in phone that our refund (4 flights) would be handled and paid back to my account in 30 days. Nothing happened and I sent refund again and phoned also. Now I got a written promise of 60 days after the beginning of the Covid ban. Again nothing and new calls  and this time I got written e-mail which says that I Have been already refunded. Not to my account though. Again new e-mails and calls and this time only they asked me to wait because you have refunded but too busy to pay. You are starting now new flights but you don't have time to pay your debts to your customers. Sounds like robbery and feels too. Your promises are empty talking and trust is gone. Try to do something, at least don't lie anymore. If you are not paying, let me know and stop talking nonsence.

5157,This is THE most ridiculous answer i have heard from any company during Covid 19 which i want to share with you. We had flight with Turkish Airlines for the 3/4/2020 which obviously did not go ahead.

So the first flights back after covid is June 10th so 60 days from that is August 10th that is when you will be issued with a refund.

Nearly half my suit case was empty as they stole everything even my coffee machine like they don’t have any in turkey (geberin) I can’t believe people are ok with stealing stuff but that’s a Muslim country ( tabi canim) I hope who ever took it rots in hell with their family and what ever they stole of mine (kismet olmasin size!!) bide Musluman ulke olacaksiniz bok!!! sevdiklerinizden ciksin benden caldiklariniz o, cocuklari, valizi bulamadiniz gelin beni bulun optum xx cehennemde yanmaniz dilegimle xx",Negative
5181,"I am Turkish and I have been using Pegasus for almost 6 years now. I've flown Pegasus at least 15 times and I have 4 active tickets at the moment. I sincerely don't understand 1 star comments. Am I flying with another airline. When you have a single bad experience, you shouldn't give 1 start right away. Also, after 15 flights, I haven't had any problems. I may be lucky to some extent but how come they all have problems on their first flight. It is hard to believe. They lost my luggage once but they found it in an hour. It wasn't the best hour of my life but it is possible to lose luggage that's why they have a lost luggage department. They have great prices and service as a low cost airline. If you expect Singapore Airline service (with 5 times the price), don't fly Pegasus. Otherwise it is a very good choice. I have never received a rude reaction from any staff. I don't believe comments on the staff like that. They definitely have a chip on their shoulder. They exaggerate hugely. Please don't believe all negative comments. Happy passengers write comments less often. Use Pegasus when you fly to/from Turkey. Do not expect British Airways service but the price is 4-5 times lower. You won't regret it.

5182,"A disgusting airline to say the least and I'm sure they'll be closing down soon. They obviously do not want to carry foreigners, as their staff was laughing at how frustrated we got due to them not explaining what was going on. Customer service was a myth and there was no warning that our flight would be delayed. We were on foot for at least 5 hours before they informed us our flights was cancelled. No water, no food just bad attitude. They killed our holiday vibes and our flight ended up being cancelled. To top it off they lost our baggage. When I contacted their customer service their redemption was ""Well we are not part of the EU"". Bravo Pegasus 👏🏾",Negative

We eventually found a flight out of the country for some hugely inflated price with another airline, but at least we were coming home. We’ve since been trying to get a refund from Vueling for our cancelled flight, but greedy sods are hanging onto everyone’s money for a service they did not provide.

The first cancelled flight, we were able to change for later dates but did have to pay an access on exactly the same flight route. Then this flight was cancelled too and also the flights that we had booked over 6 months ago for our normal summer holiday and even though we tried to re-book for later on in the year, found that the website didn't work for ""cambio de vuelo"" . So we opted for a refund, which turned out not to be a refund but an amount of money in the form of a voucher and which didn't refund the whole amount for the tickets that were paid for. Now on trying to use the vouchers to buy some flights at the end of the year, the website does have a section to ""pay with voucher"" but it doesn't actually work and has been going round and round now for about an hour without actually making a payment. This is the third time that I have tried to use a voucher without success. The Vueling website is one of the worst that I have ever experienced.

If you don't get a service for which you pay, isn't it normal that you get a refund? The flight was canceled and they didn't have any costs with regard to this flight, so isn't it normal that they do a refund? In my opinion that's robery and criminal behaviour!

I have tried to contact them via email but there is no response. I live in Uk so credit would never work out for me as Im not a domestic traveller.They give such a hassle to the customer.

Sky Tours employee Nataliya confirmed the refund of the purchase price via email on March 6th at 3.59pm MESZ. But up to this day I am still waiting for the 322 Euros that were promised to me.

I had a round trip book via Sky-Tours which had to be cancelled due to the COVID-19.

When they finally responded, after I had to send several reminders, I was told that: ""as the flights are not impacted, we can only cancel your reservation using cancellation protection. You will get a refund of the ticket amount less the deductible 100 USD per policy terms."" This worried me already as the flights were impacted and there are no flights from Bilbao, Spain to Korea. So I do not have the option to take the flight. However, I agreed to pay the fee just to have the cancellation processed. After several more communication attempts, I was sent a personal number with the following information: ""WE DO NOT OFFER A VOUCHER WE OFFER TO KEEP THE CREDIT UNDER HOLD, you need to send us the new date's reply, this email and we will help you with the change on date and amounts."" Now, for a few days already, I am trying to get information about the amount they hold as my credit and expiry date for that credit (I have somewhere).  They are responding with the same phrase again and again without to provide any further information. I cannot imagine myself booking a new flight using my credit if the only way doing it is to contact them via e-mail or form again.

Elisabeth worked relentlessly to ensure that my canceled flights back in Sept 2019 were re-booked in a manner that always held the best interest of the customer. To make the situation even more difficult, half of the time where she worked diligently every day and kept me updated every day on the progress happened during the coronavirus pandemic. The entire time I always knew and felt that I was in great hands. Elisabeth was a commsumate professional and always ensured that the communications were clear. We finally found a resolution to my case and I couldn't be happier. Sky-Tours is the real deal. Thank you!",Postive

5255,In the spring of 2019 my wife and I purchased tickets for a round trip to Germany in December 2019. Due to adverse medical conditions Pam was not able to go so we applied in early October for refunds well in advance of our departure dates. since we were told it was going to cost $65 ea. for admin fee and then a totally ridiculous extra fee of $300 ea. for no good reason we applied for a waiver of the $300 fee with a doctor's certificate. We were told it would take 4 to 6 weeks to process. I began asking questions about a week after the 6 weeks were gone by. Military Fares got me answers for a while but the departure date came and went. Eventually MF told me to contact United Airlines myself as they couldn't get anywhere. UA was very hard to get through to and had me resubmit my request using their form and I began waiting again. After the return flight date in Jan went by I checked refund status through UA and learned that I had been approved for the refunds but only for $300/ticket. When we returned from Az in mid Feb I checked again and found out the refund had been issued Jan 29th but we never got it. Then started a 7 week go around while UA sent us to some off the wall travel agency who said they had sent it to Sky-Tours and I ended up back with Military Fares and finally received a $600 refund Apr 9th. Why UA charged a $367 fee per ticket plus the $65 fee and gave us only $300 per ticket rather than charging $300 per ticket and giving us the correct refund of $367 per ticket I have not found out yet. My review here of Sky-Tours is poor because of the poor service I received all the way through with United Airlines actually deserving the poor rating. Military Fares actually helped me very well and would have earned a 4 star rating at least if it were not for United Airlines' performance.,Negative
5256,"Since I posted the below review, Sky-Tours contacted me here and via email. I have been able to rebook flights for myself and for my friend. The service rep, Matt, was very helpful and worked to resolve my issues even though it is a holiday weekend. I am satisfied that my original flights have been canceled and rescheduled. I am giving a 3 star rating because I wish the process of connecting with Sky-Tours wasn't so challenging. I do appreciate that these are unique times. _______________________________________________ I booked flights with Sky-Tours back in November. I have had to cancel my trip due to Covid-19. Now I am trying to cancel/rebook my flights, the flights I need to cancel are in 9 days! I spoke with someone at Sky-Tours back in March about our options, I was told we had to contact them with alternative dates and that both airlines we were set to fly with were allowing for free re-booking. Both airlines require re-booking through Sky-Tours, I can't go through the airlines themselves. Since then I have tried to contact Sky-Tour with our choice of alternative dates. I have called 25+ times and have not been able to reach an agent (that's not an exaggeration) I don't actually think there is ANYONE answering phones there. I filled out an online contact form 5 days ago and have not heard from anyone, I even DMed their Facebook and Instagram pages with no luck.

Also, in response to the reply below, yes, the associate said that it would take 4.5 months to cancel a flight that's in less than a month. That's not helpful. Edit #2 from 3 stars to 2 stars: People I were able to contact were polite. However, they stated a 60 business day delay. Sorry but that's ridiculous, especially compared to other flight booking sites like Flighthub where you can cancel online quickly. --- Edit #1 from 1 to 3 stars: After contacting through Facebook, I received a message. No final confirmation yet, but at least I got a response. --- Horrible experience! Stay away! I've never booked with sky-tours before, and had no problems getting a flight and paying for it. But during this pandemic, they've discontinued their 24/7 chat due to ""unusual high volume of requests"" (shouldn't the opposite be done given high requests?), and I've called their Canadian number many times but they say that they're busy and then it hangs up on you. I've also been waiting 3 weeks for them to look at my ticket, but nobody has been assigned despite the fact they say they will get back to you within 3 days. I get it's busy, but this is ridiculous.

5262,"I had a flight booked from Perth to Beijing which has been cancelled and Thai airways has proposed for the flight to be rescheduled to a date  I cannot travel on. Due to this I am entitled to a full refund which I requested from Thai Airways who referred me back to eDreams. eDreams then said they cannot refund any flights until they receive an update from Thai Airways saying they can do so, however the last update on Thai Airways refunds policy on flights to China was in January which was weeks ago. Either way this is surely irrelevant as the flight I booked has been moved which means they can’t honour the original purchase I made and therefore must refund me. I have contacted Thai Airways about helping me with the cancellation or at least giving eDreams the go ahead to cancel and refund my flight but I’ve heard nothing back from either company. This whole issue is poor from Thai Airways who are supposedly a 5 star airline as they should take responsibility for their passengers and endeavour to help them regardless of what awful company they booked through. My solution is simple, please get me a full refund -  whether that is by telling eDreams they can give it me or just telling me directly I can be reimbursed the outcome should be the same.

As my wife didi not agree , he passed the comments “ you Indians...... and threatened to remove all our checked in baggage.

5280,"Re:  Unacceptable Customer Service So I called Qatar Airways customer service today, (06/15/20 1:28PM CST 6/14/2020 from San Antonio, Texas), to see if I could get some additional information about these flights.  The person that took the call was a female named Luz.  I explained to Luz I was interested in hearing if there was truly additional fights and talked to her about possibly changing my mother’s ticket.  Luz wanted to to verify the information to make sure I was who I said I was.  She asked for the ticket confirmation number, method of payment, phone number linked to the ticket, and the email address.  After that, she asked for the date the original ticket was purchased.  I explained to her that since it has been cancelled four times due to Covid19, I couldn’t remember what date the original ticket was purchased without a lot of research.  Then she asked for the passport number.  I gave it to her and she stated it was wrong.  I gave it to her again and she said it was still wrong. So I suggested we check some other numbers off the passport, because obviously something was not right.  She made it very clear I was majorly inconveniencing her, but she said she would check.  She stated that number was wrong as well.  I asked her if we could verify with some other information, as something was not right, but she refused.  She told me to contact my travel agent and call back. I have been a loyal customer more the 20 years and this is my four extremely unpleasant experience with Qatar Airways employees, in the last two years.  The first involved your Houston Airport Qatar staff aggressively not allowing both my wife and myself to stand in the check in line with my mother - pre Covid19, even though it was evident I couldn’t assist my mother and handle the luggage at the same time.  The second time involved the extreme lack of communication to your customers, not even bothering to email or text your customers to let them know that the flight had been diverted due to the flooding in the Houston area, (Sept 2019).  Hundreds of people standing around trying to find out where their family members were and not one person there from Qatar to explain what had happened.  After hours of trying to get though your 800 number, we finally found out what happened and we had to share information amongst ourselves, as Qatar didn’t even seem to care.  Third time is when you cancelled my mother’s ticket the first time.  Had we not stopped to double check that morning to make sure the flight was leaving, we would have made the four hour drive to Dallas and been left to stare at an empty check in counter, where, we would have no doubt, not been able to get any information.  Furthermore, it was not Qatar that informed us of the cancellation, because Qatar was hanging up the phone whenever we managed to get through the line.  It was our travel agent that told us the flight was cancelled.  Add in the stellar customer service provided by Luz, and I seriously have to ask myself who did you pay to get the 2019 Airline of the Year award. Please, do something about your nasty airport personnel (Houston), get Luz some much needed customer service training, (or a pink slip), and step up your customer communications, (mass emails or text messaging is an acceptable form of communication), especially during natural disasters, because your customer service is literally taking a nose dive at a high rate of speed.  Your only saving grace has been your willingness to refund or rebook tickets cancelled due to Covid19. Sincerely, wondering if I need a new favorite airline…",Negative

5289,"I am writing this feedback to warn future customers about how Qatar treats their customers. I paid for 5 tickets, with a total value of 36000 NOK and our flight was scheduled for July. Due to Corona outbreak, there had been insecurities if there was any point travelling as there would still be restrictions in both countries. We only had 2 weeks vacation and if that would be spent in quarantine in our destination country, then there would be no point in travelling. After some discussion, it was agreed that I would send a cancellation refund request via Qatar's web page. I clicked on the COVID19 section and from there I could apply for a refund, and at that time, there was no information about what the policies there were. The refund was sent inn and after a couple of days, no one had updated my case with information, so I decided to contact their Customer Support. It is here I was informed of the policy when asking for a refund, that I would only get 18000 NOK back because there is a fee of 50% per ticket when refund is requested. I then told the support that I would like to cancel my refund request and wait instead. I got confirmation that they would inform their department about the cancellation and not worry anymore. Just in case, I also made updates on my open case, to cancel the request. After 4 weeks after I sent in the request, money was transferred to my account and it was indeed 18000 NOK. I was mad and called again Customer Support and demanded why cancellation was not done. It was also confirmed in their system that I did ask for a cancellation on April 8th and their department was notified, but they still processed my refund on April 16th. I was informed that the case would be looked into and after that it has only been down hill to hell. 1. Qatar kept giving me a ""copy and paste"" information text on how the refund request was already processed (they are not actually reading WHY I was complaining). 2. Qatar managed to share my personal data with several unknown persons and referred to me in a different name but was talking about my booking reference. Customer Support doesn't know what GDPR  law is, even though they have a business in Europe. When I raised my concerns, Customer Support only wanted to discuss my booking and didn't take my concerns seriously. 3. I was advised to contact ""tell-us"" and file a complaint there. It didn't make a difference, they are still referring to the refund they processed in April 16th and not actually handling my complaint that the refund was not something I asked for. 4. When asking to talk to a manager who can look into my complaint, Support will just brush it off. 5. The date is now June 2nd and after one month, Qatar is still not admitting to their mistake and basically putting blame on me. I don't know if there would be any difference if I was a Platinum member but in this situation, I don't feel like valued customer and Qatar just want to keep my money. Customer Support and their Refund Department do not talk to each other internally and I wouldn't be surprised if other customers have also been in this situation. Just because no one from Customer Support can DIRECTLY talk to someone from the Refund Department, I was a collateral damage and lost half of my money. I will never support Qatar and I will advise my friends, family and business colleagues to not support them either. This is a company which advertise themselves as a 5 star Airline and yet, treat their customers like garbage and just want to keep their money, even though they are at fault. Avoid Qatar Airways, you may think you will not end up in a similar situation but you will and your experience will not be much different than mine.",Negative

Long haul flight with nothing to do. Crew did nothing to help. Not good! Thai Airways head office did not care and did not make it right. They treated me like I was the problem. How can they justify selling a broken product? I did not get what a reasonable person would expect from a flight. Thai Airways did not provide the advertised product. I would not recommend flying with Thai Airways unless you have no other possible choice. What a shame!",Negative
5291,"Long story short: the Thai Airways booking website isn’t optimised for use on mobile devices. As a result, when I tried to book a flight for myself and my wife, two tickets were issued in my name, without me being offered the option to select a passenger name. This was far from the only issue, in a booking that took over an hour to make, using my iPad. I also know the site isn’t optimised for mobile devices because I have an IT background and the next day, when I made a further booking I used my PC instead and completed that booking without any problems. I contacted the Reservations team in London and a very nice lady called Grace has been extremely helpful and patient. Through several iterations going back to her colleagues in Vientiane, we arrived at a solution, which is that they would cancel one of the tickets, refund my card and I’d make a second booking in my wife’s name. A bit clunky (waiving the US$30 name change fee would have been quicker and simpler) and Grace went beyond the call of duty trying to persuade her colleagues of this, but to no avail. Anyway, not to worry, we had a solution. It was agreed with Grace that she’d send an email straight after our conversation to provide written confirmation of the arrangement and as soon as I got that then I’d book a new ticket for my wife. Tuesday became Wednesday became Thursday, became Friday and still no Email and nothing in my spam folder, so on Friday late afternoon I tried to contact Grace again. After 30 minutes on hold the call dropped and I had to go out so I left it until today. When I got through today (just the 15 minutes on hold this time) Grace was on holiday and I spoke to one of the rudest people I’ve ever encountered. We quickly established that Grace had sent an email albeit on Thursday rather than Tuesday, and that there was a typo in the email address. No big issue, Mr Rude agreed to resend the email. Throughout the conversation I was repeatedly interrupted and talked across and in a highly aggressive and bullying manner. The final straw came when I was informed that “It was your mistake making 2 bookings in the same name”. As I started to inform Mr. Rude what had actually happened he cut across me once again told me not to talk across him (I didn’t and pretty darn rich coming from him anyway), and then put the phone down on me. I’ve raised the issue with Thai Airways customer service and I hope the call will be listened to. We’ll wait and see but I will not tolerate being spoken to like this and if this turns out to be the last interaction I have with Thai Airways then they have lost me permanently as a customer once these flights have been completed. On my experiences with Grace alone, this would have been a 4 star review. On my call this morning it would have been zero stars, so I’ve settled for 2 stars as a compromise.",Negative

When the majority of airlines stopped flying, Qatar continued, enabling me to return home safely. Thank you. I will definitely book and fly with them again.",Postive

5302,"I booked tickets for a holiday in May from London to Vienna and back. The tickets are with RegioJet. Obviously the tickets got cancelled due to the virus. I didn't receive a full refund. I contacted Omio and after a while I got a e-mail saying that because RegioJet initiated the cancellation it simply isn't there problem and I have to contact RegioJet for my refund. I did this, and rightly so they told me that due to anti-money laundering laws they cannot refund the money back into an account they didn't receive it from. My only option is to travel 70 miles to the nearest RegioJet shop to claim my refund which is out of the question due to being a live in carer for someone with disabilities, it costing £30 in train tickets and it costing me at least half a day in travelling. They told me to go back to Omio for further assistance. Once again Omio told me they won't be refunding me. ""Unfortunately, as a ticket search platform, Omio is unable to issue refunds and change bus operator's policies regarding this."" So Omio can take my money into there account, take a commission, organise and book my holiday but if they get cancelled I'm left to deal with it on my own, chasing a company that has broken English e-mails? All Omio need to do is get the money refunded into there account so they can refund it back to me, its not that hard. I've since opened a Paypal dispute and i'm fairly sure under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 they'll have something to say about this. Which Omio have also added to there e-mails ""In the meantime, we kindly ask you to close the PayPal dispute"". Sure, let me just throw away any chance of me receiving my money. Absolute joke. The fact a company thinks they can treat consumers like this I actually find upsetting. Thanks for the non-existent help Omio, I won't be using your services ever again.",Postive

5325,"On October 5, 2019, my partner and I traveled to LAS from MCO with Spirit Airlines. We originally booked our flights together (not separate) a month in advance. Fast-forwarding till our day to check-in, we experienced so many issues with this airline company, that we will never recommend and fly with Spirit again. I checked in twenty-four hours in advance with their online service to save time. This method is very effective with many other airlines. We arrived at the airport and found out our flight was delayed. We were also traveling with another couple who booked flights two weeks after our initial booking. When I checked in online, I noticed me, and my partner's seats were not together. The couple we were traveling with also checked in online after us and received seats next to each other. However, my seats were in completely different zones. Our seats were originally 14 F and 16 A when we checked in online. I was not happy with this, so I kindly checked in at the gate with guest services to sort out this issue. (I've booked with many other airlines online and always get seats with whomever I'm flying with when I book tickets together). I asked the woman if she could kindly accommodate us with seats near each other or a window seat preferably. It was our first trip to Vegas, so we wanted something comfortable. We wanted to have a window to get the real experience and record some footage. The woman at guest services acknowledged that the system shouldn’t have made that mistake and also confirmed with us that it was a system error. We asked for a window seat twice and she did confirm that it was indeed a window seat. We also asked her if it was in the back of the plane, so that way we could keep our original seats if we would have to end up downgrading to something else. She stated it was nowhere near the back of the plane. Due to the inconvenience, guest services changed our seats before boarding the aircraft. However, when my partner and I board the plane, we found out we were placed in the last row of seats in the back of the plane. 31 A and B to be exact. What’s worse, there was no window! We ended up getting lied to from guest services after we both asked for accommodation since Spirit Airlines failed to sit us together. I went up and spoke to one of the flight attendants. When I thoroughly explained the situation, her response was “please take your seats in the back and I will see if I can find you additional seats.” The flight attendant knew how unsettled we were and chose for the plane to take off after I addressed our issue twice. She then told us when the seatbelt sign turns off, we can get up and find what is open. There was no apology and she seemed frustrated because I asked. I’ve worked in customer service and hospitality management for over eight years and know exactly how insincere and unsympathetic she was. There was no compassion, no help, no hospitality, and no professional customer service. She overlooked many issues and her attitude was present. Not sure if she had a long night because I understand the industry. However, when you work in customer service, you should do whatever it takes to help someone if you have the capability to. In this situation we expected the flight attendant to help us navigate where there were open seats available. She completely ignored us throughout the entire flight and to think I attended a Spirit Airlines hiring event before this is shameful. If this is the image they uphold, I don't ever want to be a part of it. We endured a horrible experience on behalf of the company’s negligence to treat us as if we didn’t book our flight together in advance. The unprofessional service we received made us feel like our patronage was not appreciated. We weren’t offered anything to compensate. Instead, we took several losses while Spirit Airlines did nothing to help their paying customers. I blame guest services and the flight attendant for not recognizing the simple request of passengers. As if it was their job? We ended up sitting in the back enduring a nearly four-and-a-half-hour flight because we felt uncomfortable to get up and search the plane for open seats. Instead of us getting a window seat and being able to get off the plane earlier, we ended up having to wait since we were the last ones. The ride was uncomfortable while we listened to the flight attendant's personal conversation the entire way. We also noticed there were many open window seats available. The principle is for the flight attendant to direct the passengers in showing them the way. When we flew back from LAS to MCO on October 8, 2019, I checked in online and the same thing happened again to our seats. We were sat separately. I've never had so many issues with an airline company. Flight attendants are usually very friendly, welcoming, helpful, etc. However, Spirit Airlines is far from it and failed to train its cabin crew with the professional basics of guest services. The outcome alone makes me conclude what kind of individuals are running the scenes behind this unprofessional company. I understand why people choose to fly and work for their competitors like Delta and JetBlue who provide quality customer service without asking. We will be letting many of our friends and family know about this experience and we are happy to not fly with them in the future. Spirit Airlines and its customer service is a disaster and their employees should be reprimanded and properly trained to assist those in need. What we received from Spirit was poor hospitality, no communication, dishonesty, and unprofessional customer service!",Negative

I called them to get the resort fees for a particular Las Vegas hotel because it did show when I tried to book a flight/hotel package deal.

He also could not pronounce the word HOTEL. After several attempts I asked to speak with someone else. Again waiting on hold forever while writing this review, Jonathan the supervisor answered. He also spoke broken English, but better. He gave me the resort fees but was unable to access the Spirit website because his terminal was malfunctioning. I wanted to know the total amount for the flight, hotel, and fees. I asked Jonathan if Spirit Airlines discounted flight/hotel package bookings and he said Spirit Airlines would have to authorize a discount. I asked if he worked for Spirit Airlines and he said yes. He asked if I was at the website and I answered no because I was writing a review. I then got a recording asking to review my experience, which I did. A few seconds later I received a call which rang only once and quit, which I assume was Spirit Airlines. The number as it appeared on my phone was +1(1)(801)257-6155.

5346,"I give it 1-2 stars for my experience below.  They get 4 stars for the actual experience on the flight and that the rebooked flight was on time. So listen to this fun story about JetBlue and their horrible customer service. Buckle up. My friend and I found a great deal to Bogota via PHX so we were supposed to leave on a redeye last night at 10:45p arriving at 6:15a today. The ONLY connecting flight to Bogota was at 7:22a the next day. They delayed our flight to 1:50AM! which forces us to miss the connection. This created a domino effect to lose one night's hotel in Bogota, lose an entire day of our trip, lose a flight the next morning to Cartagena all out of pocket (we will be filing a travel insurance claim luckily). They wanted to put us on the next day's redeye but we were leery about that flight getting delayed and creating another domino effect so we had them rebook us on an afternoon flight from LAX (which we had to pay $249 out of pocket to get to LA mind you). The LA flight gets us into FLL at 9pm tonight so we could ensure we would make tomorrow morning's flight to Bogota. Regardless of us taking the delayed redeye at 1:50a last night OR today's flight from LA, JetBlue would have had to put us up in a hotel in FLL. They are now refusing to do that because had we just rebooked our redeye from PHX to leave a day later then we wouldn't have had to stay in a hotel at all. Guess what hotels are selling for on hotwire by the airport? Between $51-68! Thanks for the epic fail JetBlue - we will never fly you again and I'm happy to share my story on all social media platforms and review sites. #Jetblue",Negative
5347,"Awfully bad experience. We traveled from FLL to SFO with my family. 1. Jet Blue prices grow much faster then other companies when you add just the basic option, in my case it was +50%, that puts this company to the same category with American Airlines, United, etc. 2. For this price you have service, that is worse than the appropriate low-cost one. In FLL the terminal where Jet Blue operates is far away from the rental cars parking, comparing to United, that operates in the same terminal. And even if Jet Blue tails and admits it, you can't get anything - no business lounge, no paid hotels, absolutely nothing. 3. I came to terminal and printed the boarding passes one hour prior to the takeoff. But the infrastructure in the airport, that works for Jet Blue, is so awfully bad that I missed the flight. The system doesn't print tags for luggage and nobody assist passengers. Finally after few attempts we came to the service desk to print them, it was 50 minutes prior to takeoff. Than we spent over 20 minutes printing the tags, it's easy to see the timestamps on the tags. Finally they didn't give us all our tags, one was missing! People were extremely slow, than was a glitch in a software, then printer didn't work. Finally 25 minutes prior to takeoff we came to the security check, where we supposed to have a separate line. Ee didn't get it even after we told that we're missing the flight. The gate was closed strictly on time and we had to go to the Jet Blue service desk. 4. People at the desk saw right from the beginning all our statuses in the system and agreed that the was no our fault in this situation. They were not able to offer anything earlier than in 24 hours, but helped to identify all our luggage tags numbers and initiated the refund (appreciate it, however, I haven't got it so far). Everything else became our problem. 5. We tried to discuss the situation with the manager on site, but this step was absolutely useless. We were waiting for him for 40 minutes, family of five people including five year old child, that already supposed to be sleeping on the plane. He told us that he's sorry about what happened but didn't offer anything to compensate our losses (time and money for the tickets that we had to buy in a last minute and hotel). He didn't say anything regarding the enormous time slots for the typical operations, that we saw. His point was that even if passengers paid for some services to get faster to the gate, one hour is not enough and we had to come earlier. But passengers should be notified about this critical issues in advance and have clear recommendations. And it doesn't mean that airlines are free from any obligations to support passengers on site. Nobody notified me that I had to plan 30-35 for each operation. I would never go for it. Overall conclusion: No way. Doesn't make sense to pay for the service if you can't get it. We had many examples of good and bad services, but this one is the worst experience that we had. All companies have problems but this time were had no support at all. In case of any troubles with Jet Blue you have reasons and explanation, but no help. They can tell you who's fault it is but they can't provide you anything after that happened. Special attitude exist only in their slogans. Worst example of low-coster with the prices of the genuine airlines. P.S. My reservation: AGZWYA.",Negative

But that changed on a recent flight from JFK to Charlotte where a 6 hour delay showed how terrible this airline has become. Yes, delays are expected when it comes to weather, but when you are at the main hub and your plane is actually at the airport and you leave 6 hours late then there is no longer a valid excuse.  Their 'bill of rights' is a joke and not worth the paper it's printed on. While our plane was literally outside the window at the terminal, it first had to fly to Nantucket then back to JFK before it could take us to Charlotte.  But Nantucket had a ground stop, for 4 hours. So instead of cancelling that flight we were impacted. This happened to one of my friends the very same night, also a 6 hour delay waiting for a plane from DR to get to JFK before they could get to FLL.  Then on our return flight the same exact problem even though we were on the 6am (first flight) from FLL back to JFK.  The plane that left the night before from San Diego was 2.5 hours late thus causing our flight to be late.   It then happened to my sister on another flight from Orlando to JFK just yesterday.

The hardship now is that jetblue is not even taking responsibility, they are saying the final carrier should handle the bags, which is fine if they sent the bags to the final carrier in the first place, they did not, they sent the bags to the cancelled carrier from the original flight. And they don’t even care, I can’t believe there are businesses like this, no sense of responsibility. There are 4 luggages, which we never know if we are ever getting them, they flew May 25th from orlando. Its May 31st, still no bags. If you have connecting flights, never fly with JetBlue, they don’t have the best service, the stress this flight has cause us has been really terrible. We feel bad about those bags, because they contain memories of a lovely vacation, which JetBlue has ruined.",Negative

5353,"04/27/2019 Over the past few weeks I have had very negative experiences when it comes to flying jet blue as have people that I have expressed this concern with. The first problem that I encountered was when my departing flight was delayed for 5 hours. However, the reason I originally found out was because a fellow passenger had service dogs and they had to inform of the delay. The delay was not posted until right before we would have originally boarded meaning they were aware prior and didn’t inform us. Another flight within the same week was cancelled and passengers were on standby for 9 hours. More recently, a flight was cancelled for an hour and then another before being cancelled as well. The next flight they could book would be a day later. Oh and while we were waiting, we saw a mouse.",Negative
5354,"We were supposed to take off a little after 5pm. Flight was delayed until 8:45pm. My fiancé and I stayed in the airport, had some food and continued checking the screens, online, and listening to announcements all throughout our delay. There was nowhere to sit right at the gate so we sat a gate over. We heard numerous announcements for other flights boarding. Around 8:15 we walked over near the gate and there were hundreds of passengers boarding other spirit flights and sitting near the gate. About 15 minutes later we notice they still aren’t boarding. We finally notice some of the spirit staff behind the counter. We go to ask them when boarding is and they said your plane just took off!!!! NOT ONE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THEY WERE BOARDING! We proceed to customer service where there is another customer who had the door at the gate slammed in his face saying oh well guess you missed it. Customer service then proceeds to tell us she heard the announcements from across the airport. How convenient she heard the announcements. What a coincidence that four passengers that do not even know each other just experienced the same thing. I then do some research after this disturbing evening and find out they bump passengers due to overbooking. So basically they quietly boarded the plane hoping no one noticed due to overbooking. I’m absolutely disgusted and can not believe this airport is in business. It’s disturbing how these people get away with this. I wasted 6 hours at Fort Lauderdale airport to try and get to Texas for my fiancé’s grandmothers 80th birthday. And the sick thing is these people at spirit airlines will continue to do this and get away with it because spirit is supposed to be cheap and convenient for people.

5355,"To review Spirit on a honest level I would have to first exclude the mobil app, customer service, quality of the plane and the overall flying experience when aboard a Spirit Airlines aircraft. This review would be for the website and nothing more. The website itself is ok to use - a little shaky at times but I don't know if that's because of the high volume of users on the website or not. You can purchase tickets, check luggage and pick your seat for a fee if you prefer or they will randomly pick a seat for you - free. They also have extra leg room seats and wider seats for a fee. You can also pick options for expedited Security checks, faster lines  and boarding calls for extra fees if you choose to do so. So on the ""up and up"" the website itself is not that bad to navigate and get your business done.",Postive

My husband decided had decided to try flying verses driving like we normally do from Columbus, Ohio to Orlando, Florida. I'm scared to death of heights an plane's. He purchased tickets with spirit months before our flight. And do to his size 6'7 300+ pds we decided to spend the extra money round trip to upgrade to the big seats an assigned seats so he could fit comfortably an so we were sitting together an kinda alone. We had no issue leaving Columbus. Our flight out of Columbus was scary for me just cause I had a panic attack. I wish I could give our attendant a 5 star review. He deserves it. He seen I was scared an crying. An went above an beyond to help calm me an comfort me bringing me tissues. He really was very helpful. An I would love to Thank him again. My 1 star is for the problem on way back. Like I said we not only paid for big seats. But also for assignment seats to sit together. All our documents showed we had the same seats that we had on our flight to Orlando for our returning flight until after we checked in for returning flight. They had then had me in seats we paid for but had moved him 4 rows back.  We couldnt call to reach anyone due to being on cruise. So I tried their Facebook contact us info. With generic and untimely  responses.

After already paying extra for him to take one carry on they wanted to charge an additional $65 which he didn't have a credit card or enough cash. The person at the gate wouldn't take my card over the phone, said no way. Had to get a supervisor to let me pay it. He doesn't have a lot of money and isn't very educated and they treated him like crap. They were so ugly to him. He isn't educated but has a heart of gold.

You are only allowed one carry on item.byou have to pay 65.00 for the other item. Then the pilots don't show up to fly the plane. Don't fly this pitiful airline.

I have flown American Airlines for years and had gotten to Executive Platinum for several years in a row. My new job has me traveling to more cities that have direct Delta flights so I thought, for the convenience why not? I booked several trips including a flight through Asia using the Delta customer service team to guide me through the process of choosing the correct flights to ensure I achieved my goal of getting Platinum status. As the program was coming to a close I called to confirm my final flight would meet all the criteria. I CALLED TO CONFIRM... That means on the phone the customer service rep reviewed my miles and cash. They confirmed my status was assured so I carried on. Fast forward to my conversation with the customer service team today. After being passed to a manager I was informed that it was my problem and that their was a calculator I should have used. So I asked... ""So when I called, shouldn't the rep have done that work?""... ""Yes, however if they didn't you should have made sure it was done."". I mean what?? So now calling isn't enough I also need to double check their team is doing the work? Traveling overseas is stressful. Having status that gets you upgraded helps, a lot.

5374,"This is my first and last time ever flying JetBlue. Thanks for ruining my honeymoon. From the very beginning it has been awful and has turned into a nightmare since then and unfortunately we’re not even done yet... First we needed a name added to our ticket and for 5 hours were bounced back and forth between JetBlue and Expedia. JetBlue repeatedly told me there was nothing they could do and then finally made the change after 5 hours of hair pulling insanity. While at the airport they told us our flight was so delayed we’d miss our connection through Ft. Lauderdale and rerouted is on a later flight through Boston—now putting us in 3 hours later to the Bahamas. Even that flight is now delayed over an hour and we land in Boston and run to the gate where a JetBlue employee immediately tells us that it’s too late to board and that it was our fault we missed the plane because we’ve been at the airport for over an hour. We spent several minutes arguing with her that we just barely arrived and ran straight to this gate but she was convinced we’d been at the airport for over an hour until she finally saw that we were right on her computer. We had to go to someone else to rebook our flight and now we have yet another connection through Ft. Lauderdale (our original connection) and we are getting into the Bahamas over 8 hours late. And by the way, while we were staring at the check in desk in SLC for 30 minutes waiting for them to finally figure out our ticket, EVERY single other person who checked in for various other flights were also told their flights were delayed. To top it off the plane was old and uncomfortable. And the chair was broken on the second seat that I shouldn’t have even had to fly on—it was stuck in recline mode and would bounce up and down without locking. So JetBlue single-handedly slashed our honeymoon by 25% because were losing the whole day and all they offer us is a cheap airport meal voucher. Thanks for everything JetBlue, including making my wife cry. This is the worst experience I’ve ever had with an airline and they continue to keep messing things up so I’m stuck in Boston fully expecting to miss more flights and keep getting rerouted. I’ll be asking them to book me on a different airline on the way back but I expect more ridiculous excuses.",Postive

FOR FIVE MINUTES that we wouldn't even have been late if we would have been assisted in a timely manner by the FIRST representative that helped us. Instead, Delta made ZERO attempt to assist my family in getting home, getting our bags to the plane, or even the next flight would have been fine, and gave us a monopolizing choice: You either cough up at least $1,500 or we are SOL (s___ out of luck).  We had to spend $600 in renting a car, staying at a hotel, gas and purchasing meals to DRIVE DOWN from Atlanta to Miami for 10+ hours of driving time.

5385,"Just a few weeks in advance they changed several of my upcoming itineraries out of the blue with no offer of refund or compensation whatsoever. One of the changed itineraries is a big change and really messed up my travel plans. First of all, I paid for a specific itinerary and they just decide to change it to an inferior itinerary. Secondly, I have a non-refundable domestic flight (not SIA) that I can no longer use with the new itinerary so I have to buy a new USD 100 ticket. So, I am USD 100 out of pocket and have a poor itinerary that I did not buy and would not have bought in the first place. Customer service, let alone common respect for entered agreements, is non-existing with SIA. 3 weeks ago my domestic flight (not SIA) got re-scheduled and I arrived very early at MNL so I went to the SIA counter and asked if they could put me on the 2 hour earlier flight to Changi. My flight from Changi to Europe would be the same. So, I would have a 5 hour lay-over in Changi instead of 3 hours. Not that I was particularly keen to be exposed to the coronavirus in Changi for another 2 hours but in case there would be a delay this would give me even more buffer time. SIA replied that they could do that but asked me to pay a change fee. I declined and took my original flight. I might think it is poor customer service but I acknowledge that they were in their full right to want to charge a change fee although it is in both our interest to increase my buffer time to reduce the risk of missing my connection. However, now that they changed my next itineraries I don't hear them talking about them paying a change fee to me. I fly Europe to Asia return 12-15 times a year and am a Krisflyer gold member. It is not OK to change and provide an inferior itinerary for the same price for any customer. Period. But I cant help but be flabbergasted that they do this to a loyal customer.

5388,"My worst nightmare happened on December 13. It all started when me and my friend arrived an hour and 15 minutes early at the Fort Wayne international airport. We had both already checked in online and had all are seats picked out. All we needed to do was get the actually Boarding pass and have them take our bags. The problem was that nobody was there to check us in, and when they finally were that’s when everything went South. Let me add right now that this was my first time traveling internationally to a place I have never been, but it would be fine because I was with my friend who was from there right? Wrong. Because they came back late to check people in we were both late now. My friend was in front of me and was getting help, or so I thought. When it was my turn to get checked in the guy did it really fast with no problems and I had my tickets. However my friend still didn’t get hers. He kept saying she was late for the bag check in, but that was wired to me because they just took my bag. He then said he would get her on the next flight so I should get on mine before I miss it. I was really starting to freak out at this point because I didn’t want to fly without her. I was now at the Minneapolis airport waiting for my friend. I get a call from her saying that they gave her a fake itinerary ticket and that if she wants to fly she has to buy a new flight for 11000. I then start seeing this in a whole new light. From how the first guy who was helping her was acting. It seemed to be a racist issue, me being Caucasian and my friend being Asian. I got the help and she didn’t. And they Separated  us when we needed to fly together since it was my first time flying to Asia and I didn’t know her family yet and didn’t speak the language.

5390,"Sorry it is a long one. I would have been a loyal Delta customer, considering how much I have to travel internationally, however, I have had the worst experience traveling with an airline supposedly to be one of the best in America. On 13 December 2019, my friend and I had a flight to travel to Hanoi, Vietnam from Fort Wayne International Airport. We arrived at the airport an hour and 15 minutes before the flight considering both of us checked in last night and that we both have seats for 3 of our flights and traffic is not bad early in Fort Wayne International Airport. Let's begin with there was no one at the counter to help customers with baggage. We waited and waited for someone to help with baggage and were informed that we were late for our flight. The strange thing is that my friend got checked in with her bags and given boarding pass while the person who was printing my ticket keeps telling me that my plane has left and there is no way he can print my tickets. Can I just say that my friend was behind me in the line and somehow she got her ticket and I was refused to be given mine? Later on, I questioned the reason why I cannot get it and none of the people who work there could give me a valid answer rather than we got on right at the cut off time. She was Caucasian American and I was Asian so you know maybe they just don't like Asian people that much. It does not stop there. It is a long story, please bear with me. So as you may know, I missed my flight, for one of the probable reasons that I cannot change is the fact that I am Asian. The person who was checking my baggage for me in (if he was seriously working and not arguing and yelling at people about how we should all not mess with him I might have gotten on the plane but it is okay). This guy offered to ""switch me over to the next possible flight with no cost."" He even printed me a ""confirmed"" itinerary. I asked about 5 times how much does it cost to be switched over and he said he just did it, I do not have to pay for anything. Well, do you really think I was going to believe someone after they just separated me and my friend which caused her to travel across continents by herself to a country that she knows nothing about and nobody? No, I did not believe him. So I called Delta the customer service line to ask about this ""confirmed"" situation. They told me this ""your ticket was never issued"" and proceed ahead to wipe off everything in the system that has my name on it. Kudos to you all for the effort of trying to cover your problem up by wiping everything off the system. I rushed to the airport to ask further about the situation and again they told me an answer that cannot be more clear: ""So your ticket was issued but not really issued, do you know what I mean?"" I am sorry I do not know what did she mean by that, I asked about 5 times if this confirmed means confirmed and everyone said yes and suddenly after the phone call they could not find my name in the system and I gotta pay $11000 if I want to get on that flight home. Is this a common practice to issue fake ""confirmed"" itinerary and give vague answers to every single problem that occurs? Or am I a singular person experience this? I can tell you that I have gone across continents about 16 times and I have tried American Airline, United, Alaska, Asiana, China, Qatar, Cathay Pacific, Japan, AirFrance, Vietnam Airline, KoreaAir, Japan, EVA, etc but Delta was the WORST of them all.

So, I called SQ and it took me about an hour before someone answer. I did not even asked for a refund but just request to them to allow me to use the last segment of my flight which is Singapore Perth. It was unbelievable and unfair totally because they asked me to pay $720 dollars per person just to allow me and my wife to use the last segment of my flight. I mean we could buy another ticket which only cost us a fraction of that. I was so mad and questioning of whether people should downgrade this mostly spoken airline. It was totally absurd and unfair treatment to customer and so selfish of handling the issues. Putting more weight of people that already suffered. They can only say sorry for the inconvenience caused. I will just let God do His justice upon them as we are just a small customer that cannot do anything other than writing this small complain on the internet which they probably would not pay attention to it.

5398,"3 economy. 1 business class journey review. More expensive than other airlines for the same max capacity seat configuration well at least in the 350, 787. On one leg my bag was damage and needs to be replaced, no Singapore staff at airport baggage area. i emailed Singapore airlines and waited 3 weeks to be told that they needed to be contacted in writing and not email within 7 days, and that was that. During the journey i was unable to eat the food at all on two legs, i ordered a special allergy meal and the food was inedible, on one leg it was cook ok and edible but of poor quality. The business class was ok but nothing better than a ready meal from a supermarket, the food at changi 7 eleven was much nicer, onigiri for dollar 1.3, i suggest people to buy food while in transit for your flight... But the gate guards might yell at you. The lounges (ambassador and Singapore silver) were very poor. 3/5 of the staff were hostile in changi; small, full and dark and food was really disgusting. Changi ""world's best airport"" is more of gimmick than truth, having security checks at the gates for transit passengers ruins the journey, the staff pushes you though a little check point with 500 passengers trying to get through at the same time, economy or business you still treated like a criminal, because changi can't be bothered to secure the airport,... Other airports have transit arrivals and departures in the same area with no gate checks. it's stressful and pointless...with no toilets at the gate and no liquids allowed through...why do i need to argue every time i go to a gate in changi that the picture in my passport is me??? Singapore airlines gives you a 20 dollar voucher but I found nothing worth buying. Changi like a prison with one of the great malls of the world inaccessible (if you have less than 5 hours transit) through the skytrain window. Singapore airlines and changi make you feel like a commodity for the city state, than a valued guest or tourist. During the flight the staff rammed my hand and banged my elbow from behind with the cart. I had my arm on the arm rest...i wasnt intruding into the gap. They hurt me and didn't apologize but instead told me ""to be careful"" in a angry tone and moved on. After that the staff started to warn people before coming through... So every so often i had to wake up and put my arms in my lap to avoid being harmed...they are on the limit for the cart to scrape through... On two legs the staff were ok and polite, the other times they were fake, rude and they just seemed hostile... especially at Singapore night time. What's with segregation of staff race??? The racism in Singapore airlines and Changi is tangible. The toilets were crowded but ok for 3 legs. On one leg the bin was full and there was ""anal matter"" on the wall and the bowl was full of mess. On a 14 hour flight the crew disappeared after 3 hours for 10 hours there was very little service, very poor hydration. I see no reason to fly with Singapore airlines again. Seeing their business class is 2 to 3 more expensive than others even Qatar's Q suites for example. Their economy is expensive for the configuration...the seat might offer a little more reclining but just as thin as KLM, but KLM fares can be 50% or more cheaper.",Negative

I have found this airline lacking in efficiency in SO MANY areas. The one that bugs me the most is their phone system. It's so hard to get through to a live person in the area where I need help. I finally had to settle for trying to reach a travel agent as there was no other place to be connected to a live person. I'm still on hold after 31.29 minutes while I type. Very annoying to hear the same silly voice repeating the same message over and over again. Her apologies about being sorry to keep me waiting sounds SO HOLLOW!!! Just give me prompt service. Hire more people to do the job right and efficiently. And do not hire someone from India, Philippines or elsewhere who have no freaking idea what they are talking about when you try to get an answer. They speak poor English, with a heavy accent, keep repeating themselves, repeating after me. The management at Singapore Airlines had better heed passengers' complaints, and begin implementing quality control. Better yet, they should call their own customer lousy service number and experience the frustration firsthand. I don't know how Singapore Airlines ever win awards??!!! Just so undeserving. A poor reflection of the country and the governing body :( !!!",Negative

Turns out that one set of tickets did go through. We were admonished by a call center staff member and accused of not being truthful as "" you received the email and the ticket.""  To cut a long story short it took from the 9th November until a week ago for us to get over 15 000 AU$ back. It cost me at least 8 hours in phone calls, calls to my bank and emails. At one point they refused to acknowledge that they owed me money.  At all times I was apologised to for the inconvenience.

There customer service is very poor, Singapore want customers to do all the flight bookings online and do not offer an accessible customer service, telephone access is almost non-existent, and that which is offered is via a premium rate number. The big rip off with Singapore airllines is their administration charges if you wish to amke any changes to your flight booking, if you do it yourself online then expect to be charged around 40% of the original flight cost, but if you ring the reservations desk on their premium rate number you will be charged approximatel y the full cost of the airfare all over again if you wish to make changes to your flight booking.

5429,"Very disappointed, never again! Will advise family and friends not to use Singapore Airlines. We flew London to Bali via Singapore in Oct 2019. The short flights were fine (Singapore - Denpasar) but the long-haul legs of the journey were among the worst I've experienced, even compared to standards of European budget carriers. The space was incomprehensibly small, passengers sitting behind me complained when I reclined my seat after meal service, they lost my husband's suitcase for 3 days and damaged 2 brand new good quality AWAY suitcases, our luggage was delivered an hour late after landing in London so had to pay for the taxi waiting and there were lots of sick people on board so we all got a stomach bug on our return (granted this was not their fault). We also had a really short connecting time at Changi airport coming back from Bali so literally sprinted in order to make our London flight. I felt really unsafe flying back from Singapore with my two children (14 and 11) as the aircraft was clearly old and outdated, it was smaller with 3x3 seats in each row. The turbulence for the first leg of the journey above Asia was the worst I've experienced and it lasted a 4-5 hours. The older woman behind me was very tall and had a cane, she kept telling me I was hurting her leg by reclining my seat! I am 5'4"" and the person in front of me had reclined their seat so I had no choice unless I wanted my nose to be pressed against the screen in front. This was after meal service and it made me feel awkward the whole flight. She was even leaning over trying to push my seat back up when I went to the toilet! The staff did nothing about this. It was a packed flight, a man was very heavily sick in the toilet the whole night and the smell was intolerable. I felt sorry for this man as I couldn't see anyone helping him, he was so unwell. When I wrote a letter explaining everything we had endured, they just apologised for a few of the things and explained this is within their policy. It was really undignified treatment, especially the return flight which let a very bad impression. They are only interested in profit, at whatever human cost. No regard for the little things that make a difference, not even an attempt to make things right. The response to my letter was the last insult, I will not fly Singapore Airlines again if I have any choice, hope others don't fall into the same trap!",Negative

Breakfast and lunch were served in reverse, which just felt weird, and one of my meals was so inedible I asked for something else and waited forever for them to decide if I could have it.  They seem to think that gluten free also means everything else remotely possible as an intolerance had to be excluded as well, so I got nothing that even resembled food! Last year the gf food was a better experience.  Their in-flight entertainment movies aren't anything special, with little in the way of the new releases they'd normally show. Their krisflyer air miles seem almost worthless too. Overall it was so average an experience this time, I'm considering using a different airline next year, for comparison.

I frequently travel in the USA and China and any other website I use will tell me that a visa IS required for whatever country I am traveling to. While I don't fully blame ctrip for that, the series of events later are totally on ctrip. Since I got stuck in xiamen during my layover to Vietnam, ctrip told me they will cancel my return flight back to shanghai. They said this is their policy since I couldn't fly to Vietnam on the original ticket. However, on 12/24/17, I missed a flight to Xi'an, booked through ctrip. I bought a new plane ticket at the airport, and flew back on my original flight that i purchased to come back to Shanghai. Where was their cancellation policy then? On top of this, they told me in an email they will book a new flight back to Shanghai for me, tax free. I replied to their email accepting that offer. Then they took the offer back and never helped me buy tickets back to Shanghai. When I questioned them, they never responded to my email. Since I had a delay in getting to Vietnam, all my hotels and tours were delayed one day. I spent a lot of money to get my visa done in less than 12 hours, spent a lot more money on new flight tickets home, then had to book more hotels since again, ctrip would not help AT ALL! This is the worst, most awful company to use when traveling. I have all my emails and I wish I had the phone calls recorded. When calling ctrip, you'll get someone who will say ""I understand your problem and I'll escalate it"" only to get a call or email saying ""we can't help you."" In fact, I talked to the hotel and asked if ctrip ever contacted them about changing my dates, they said ""no"". UPDATE: Update to my post. Ctrip did refund me a partial amount. Far from the full amount that I paid for the flight (about 1/5 of the flight price), but its better than nothing. I am grateful for the partial refund, but I still will not use this company due to their policies and how unhelpful they were while the problem was occurring.",Negative
5471,I recently used Ctrip while traveling in China and boy I wish their services were so well developed outside China! It was so easy to manage all our logistics from trains to buses and local park fees. Love it! Excellent platform!,Postive
5472,"I don't know why there's a lot of bad reviews for this company but so far my experience with them had been great! Booking flights and hotels is very easy, price is the cheapest and their customer service is very nice and friendly. The app is also very convenient for me specially since I'm always busy and on the go. Thank you Ctrip!",Postive
5473,"Booked a train ticket on ctrip from Shanghai to Suzhou. Our flight into Shanghai was delayed so we wanted to change the train ticket to a later time, which the website said we could do. However, there was no button on the website to do this. They make the cancellation so difficult and convoluted to make sure you can't cancel. Will never use them again.",Negative
5474,"Refunding of Booking number 6428413780 I have the most unfortunate dealing with your company. I booked for a trip from shanghai to Toronto on June 7,2018 at 18:53 and in almost 3-4 hours I cancelled the trip. As advised on the website I paid the 183 Yuan fee for refund. However, when I called the helpline I was told I will not be refunded for my amount of CNY5653 of the flights. It is illegal. I checked both United Airlines and Air Canada website and if you cancel within 24 hours, and when your trip is more than a week away you get a FULL REFUND. This seems fraudulent if the company retains this money and I will take a legal recourse if my money is not refunded. Along with that I will be forced to write reviews on all possible sites so that this incident is known. Please refund the amount as soon as possible.",Negative
5475,"I booked internal return flights in China through Ctrip. A month before my flights they contacted me and said that the flight had changed to the next day. To get a visa for China you have to pre book all accommodation. I told them that this change did not work with my itinerary, I wanted to cancel the return flights. They then said that they would refund the return flight that was changed but not the outbound flight that was unchanged. When I said that I booked a return flight and that a one way flight was no use to me they said that it was their policy as the outbound flight hadn't changed. What a scam. Book people on flights that do not exist, than move them to other dates and if you can not juggle your trip they keep half the airfare. I am so happy I have not booked my train travel through Ctrip. I would not recommend anyone deal with this company. They make up their own rules and do not care about customer service. Avoid or beware. Cheers Chris",Negative
5476,"When booking flight tickets, Ctrip often offers two or more prices, e.g., (a) RMB 9773 for tickets with (no cancellation | no check-in luggage for one leg), (b) RMB11965 for tickets with (cancellation instruction | free check-in luggage). When one clicks for the cancellation instruction, it says ""see next page"" (after pressing the booking button). This misleads the customer to start booking (b) with an impression of cancellable tickets. With the difficulty to find the icon for reading the instruction, a customer often realises that (b) is NOT cancellable only after receiving the booking confirmation. By then the customer has paid more than RMB 2000 for checking-in a piece of luggage in one leg. I was one of the victims for this unfair and unethical practice. When I queried Ctrip customer service, after two polite correspondences, Ctrip terminated the conversation by returning an email saying the mailbox is full. How can such a major Chinese travel company be lowering itself to this level? Update: Ctrip contacted me fairly promptly. Credits to both Trustpilot and Ctrip for re-establishing the company-customer correspondence. A customer service officer rang and offered RMB500 compensation as the tickets have already been issued. There was about over RMB 1700 overpricing, RMB500 is better than nothing but would still leave me more than RMB1200 out of pocket. This was followed by a second customer officer (speaking good English) to check the outcome. I will update this review again when I have received the partial refund (about 30%).",Negative

(d) They do ask for credit card before making the booking (as claimed by another review giving negative rating), but as far as I could see they do not charge on the card at that time. After the reservation is confirmed by you, then they send a card authorization form and then the credit card is charged. The communication/language is little difficult to understand if you are used to speaking to native American speakers. But the patience of the agents makes it up for that.

5503,"FINAL REVIEW - 3 May 2018 Thanks to TrustPilot, Service Manager Oliver from Ctrip called everyday until EVERYTHING was sorted out My opinion about TOTALLY TURNING THINGS AROUND has be voted a 5 STAR ... With this amount of effort to change a NEGATIVE to a POSITIVE, Ctrip will WIN and keep WINNING Our Company is up and running with Ctrip now and the problems have been sorted out, in a short space of time! Therefore I change my -ve to a +ve +++ This has taught me that nothing is final and change can be a very positive thing ... Actually this is the most POWERFUL ""Negative"" to ""Positive"" that I have experienced in my fairly long lifespan on Mother Earth! Thank you! FOLLOW UP REVIEW - 19 & 20 April Service Manager Oliver, Thank you for contacting me telephonically on both days and beyond, since this review ... Ctrip's Billing Department are in the process of transferring money through to my Bank account now, thanks to your efficient follow ups. I await assistance with the mapping of Ctrip to the channel manager SiteMinder and trust from the previous experience with you, that this will happen very soon. An update is in the making INITIAL REVIEW April 2018 ""HOTEL"" IN AUSTRALIA Today out of sheer frustration I am writing to Ctrip and would like to rate them ""ZERO"" We were told that they are an International Company driving to send guests to Australia, especially to Sydney and the Blue Mountains. We began our horrendous journey trying to set up a two-way integration with the channel manager Myallocator ... this did not happen until the channel manager was changed to HotelRunner six months ago ... then out of the blue we received an overbooking (from our first and only Ctrip guest). Since this overbooking we have been trying in vane to map/integrate HotelRunner and Ctrip ... Since this booking (which we were fortunate enough to honour because we had a spare suite) WE HAVE NOT BEEN PAID - this dates back almost three months now, and the worst part of it all is that nobody, absolutely nobody will put me in touch with the Billing/Accounts Department and Ctrip Support only sends many automated messages saying that a representative will contact us within 24 hours - this NEVER HAPPENS? We were able to make contact with a Ctrip representative from Melbourne, Australia about five months ago, but this experience has been COMPLETELY FRUITLESS. So until Ctrip get their act together I would HIGHLY NOT RECOMMEND DEALING WITH THEM!",Postive

5505,"Hello everyone! First of all, I have to say that couple of service center managers were helpful, others, for instance Roii whatever his real name is, simply are simply ignorant and rude. I booked a hotel room on the 14tb April in Guangzhou city and was supposed to spent a night their after my trip back from Hong Kong with my b/friend and his mum. I paid the room fee (I hit the booking confirmation with the following note: “you don’t have to do anything more, just enjoy your stay”- haha!!!) and prepared 300 rmb as a deposit (this is what Chinese hotels usually charge you while checking in, you get refunded with this money the day you check out) . Arrived , it turned out I had to pay another 398rmb (amount of the overnight rooms fee) at the desk!!! I claimed I had already paid this amount yet the receptionist stayed deaf to my arguments, plus didn’t speak English. Being exhausted and 00:00 having no other choice except that one we had to pay 698 rmb (in addition to those 398rmb I already paid online) where 300rmb deposit was included. The receptionist assured me I get reimbursed when checked out. I addressed the service center of Ctrip.com and received a reply that those money I paid online was pre-authorization fee and  I’ll get within the next 7 working days.....crazy as hell. WHY DO I PAY TRIPLE FEE AT ONCE AND HAVE TO WAIT FOR MY PRE-AUTHORIZATION FEE WHATEVER IT IS ANOTHER WEEK GIVEN I ALREADY PAID THE HOTEL FEE AT YHE DESK FOR THE NIGHT I SPENT THERE ?? Never in my life have I encountered such a madness !",Negative
5506,"Hello, Sorry CTRIP, even though today is the very first day when i found out about your existence i am giving you 0 stars. I never used or heard of ctrip.com till this morning when i received a email notification from my American Express account saying that i was declined to purchase some $326.00 (whatever) trip or travel service from ctrip.com. How did they know about me and my credit card-no idea. Past few days i've been using skyscanner.com to search some flights...but i have never bought anything from them either. Though now i know that CTRIP owns skyscanner... And They may see my info through it. Not sure...what i am sure about is: 1) Credit card replacemnet 2) Deleting skyscanner app on my phone 3) Never ever use or recomend ctrip.com to anyone. Excuse my incorrect english...i am a half-american/half-russian. And i am the one who never really write negative reviews. Though i feel like i have to in this case to warn peolpe. Next day (April 6th): My reply to CTRIP. Hi Oliver, Thanks for your reply and apologies. And i believe that ""Normally, we wouldn't charge your card for something that you didn't order from us or use your card without your permission."" Though i am still shocked that that happened...and that CTRIP knew about me and my  credit card info and even used it before i even knew nothing about them. After i left my first review last night i googled CTRIP a bit more. So...Now i know that CTRIP has offices in several cities and collaborates with other travel companies :Skyscanner, Tours4fun, trip.com. And i just rechecked that yesterday's declined credit card transaction and it says the full name of the merchant:"" Ctrip Com Hong Kong Limited"" So Oliver, I don't have anything personal against you...Though i have it against the whole CTRIP system and company. So this review will remain ""0"" stars... April 9th: Hi Oliver, I just sent  (forwarded) that american express email about that declined CTRIP transaction you asked about. Hopefully it will never happen again...not to me or to anyone. May  27th: Oliver...what are you talking about? I already emailed you American Express notification about that transaction (  Read my reply i wrote above on April 9th). And you emailed me back asking me to provide these 3 things: 1.     Card number (complete/full card number) 2.     Transaction date and my phone #. What? There's NO WAY i will ever send my credit card number to the company that stole my identity and used that against me. Please, do not reply. This review is getting only worse with your repeated messages. And folks! This is my experience with this company i have never tried to have any experience with. If i was one of you i would definitely try some (if not anything else) other online travel agency. Happy Summer everyone!",Negative
5507,"I purchased tickets with Ctrip in Jan this year, I noticed the middle name was incorrect, so I contacted their Customer Service Dept. They said the info I gave was incorrect when I booked my ticket. I could not prove as the info was in their system.  After waiting for nearly a week for their feedback,  They confirmed they could not change the name for me - the service was terrible, rude and no explanation was given.  I then contacted Hongkong Airline, they told me that they could not help as it is agent's policy. Ctrip made no effect at all to help me, they don't show any care to their customer.   I have to purchase a new set ticket.  I will never book any trip with this company again !!!",Negative
5508,"Awful experience. I had to book 3 flights for a business trip in the same week and suddenly until I went to the airport, the airline told me that my booking was for last month??? How could it be possible if the other 2 flights were booked this week, this month? I'm not convinced that I indicated the wrong date (17 Feb) because it was not even Tuesday, I'd never have confused like that. Read up on Google there were many customers complaining about the same issue. I had expected Ctrip to be more reliable before this. A total scam!",Negative
5509,"Ctrip cannot make the refund I booked the flight on behalf of my son from Japan to Hong Kong in May two days ago.  When I booked, I could not get the confirmation no.at once instead of processing  order no. I have a sense of little bit scare, then I search the information of company.  Their reviews gave me more concern so I  made the cancel right away.  Since they wrote that you can cancel the booking within 30 min, so I required the cancellation. They said they need to send me verification code to view my account status. So I proceed,  but haven't received any  verification code.   After 30 min I checked my credit card they made the payment already.   I felt so strange, may be I had a little bit over react  I stopped my credit card and replaced with a new one. After discussing with my son,  we decided cancel the booking, As they mentioned in the web site, there should be a cancel order button on a booking details.  But we cannot find that button. Then I emailed them yesterday, they told my son no money back if I cancel the flight. I don't know what's going on.  It seems like scam.

5533,"Ctrip delivered what they promised, so I can't complain - but with a confusing customer service. They are legit and didn't rip me off - I want to provide a counterpoint to some other reviews here. Although they specialise in East Asia, I found them on Skyscanner offering a deal (much cheaper) price on a flight from the UK to Europe. I clicked through, where they asked for my passport details and asked me to pay upfront. This seemed unusual, as passport details are only needed at check-in, not to buy the ticket. I went ahead and paid, and received a email acknowledging payment and saying that 'Ticket(s) will be issued no later than 72 hr before departure of the first flight. Your ticket confirmation and itinerary will be emailed to you once your tickets have been issued'. No ticket. At this point I was scared - in this age of electronic databases, you expect orders to go through almost instantly (this has been the case with every other online travel agent I've used), and I began to doubt they even had the flight ticket as advertised. I then received an email from Skyscanner: 'Ctrip have notified us that it's taking longer than usual to finalise your booking. You should hear from Ctrip within an hour but this can sometimes take longer.' I did not hear back within an hour. What finalisation? Eventually, I received confirmation that my flight was booked the next day, along with a booking reference (PNR) for my airline. From then onwards, everything went fine - I enetered the PNR on the airline website, it was valid and booked just as requested. I checked in and took the flight. So the moral of the story - Ctrip did deliver, but with an explained delay, and an unintuitive email correspondence (sent from China). Some explanation in advance that issuing the tickets takes some time would have improved the experience. It seems I had a better experience than some reviews on here.",Postive

They actually weren't, the prices for those flights were just higher than what I paid, so I was either forced to leave at 6am or 6pm. I ended up cancelling, losing the money and booking directly with the airline. Ctrip was a waste of money, inconvenience, and completely unreliable.

I was told I need to pay a fee of NZ$250, then after asking for a manager, the customer service lady said I can pay the difference in fares to change flights. However, the pricing on the website must be different to what they see since they were asking for. E.g. the online price difference was $15, but they asked for $55. When I finally said okay to the $55 difference, they transferred me to an automated payment method which said my credit card number was incorrect. Then it was transferred me back to another customer service agent who put me on hold to try sort it out. He asked for the first six digits of my card over and over again, which I answered. Then it went ot the automated system and FINALLY the payment went through. TL;DR - If you can avoid using Jetstar, please do! Go with AirNZ - they try their best to help.",Negative

So in short - for a round trip ticket, by default they give you more luggage for your arrival flight and less for your departure, in an apparent bait-and-switch trap to trick customers into paying extra luggage fees.

5550,"This airline has the rudest most arrogant people ive EVER come across. Ive used them only the once and that is enough for me.I had to pay an extra $75 for another flight as of there were no jetstar staff to check my son in and plus a fee for being late. How late is late when your there  an hour early like jetstar told us???? What is this airline about? Then we had to pay extras, then told he couldnt board the plane. The steps were still attatched and the door to the aircraft still open. You are the worst airline ive ever used. Owned by quantas i thought they were ok ha i was dead wrong. Alan joyce you want to stop scamming people with your guidelines which are total BS. Im a modern 60 year old travelled woman and while i told jetstar staff i wouldnt use them or recommend them to anyone in a civil voice, I had 5 staff  around me while having to pay you more money I mean im a small built person and semi disabled,to have 3 security officers around me ffs i never raised my voice nor threatened anyone and was treated like a peice of filth. A bit of commen decency goes a long way to a customer. How do you check in when you can only find 1 jetstar staff member only 1 coming down the stairs of the aircraft??? Your jetstar staff should be ashamed of themselves as even the guys who do your security said quote unquote ""if you fly jetstar dont get a late or early flight as they constantly do this to there customers"". Totally disgusted. Virgin will be once again my mode of flying. Jetstar SHAME SHAME SHAME!!!!!!!",Negative
5551,After ordering patches for our uniforms for the past 5 years with Aviator Gear we will be finding a new vendor. Our last order did not include the velcro backing to sew onto our flightsuits. The past 5 orders have included the loop velcro backing. I inquired about this being left out and I was informed that Aviator Gear no longer supplies the loop backing for their patches yet I paid the same price that I have paid for our last 6 orders. When I questioned customer service they said to just go to Michael’s and buy loop velcro. No thanks. I’ll go to another vendor that can complete the entire mission for us. Thanks for the good work you did for us in the past but time for us to move on!,Postive
5552,"This outfit is not trustworthy.  Made a reservation which was cancelled only to have them offer a slightly higher rate for the same flight (declined). Made a second booking for same trip for them to cancel the reservation saying that the airline (American) had cancelled the flights based upon the Beoing AirMax safety issues.  Only problem is that I called American and not only are the flight NOT cancelled, they were NOT using those aircraft. IMO, They are either farming the credit card info, or performing a bait and switch scam.",Negative
5553,"I would like to make known my massive gratitude to the pilot(s) of JetStar Flight JQ661 from Ayres Rock (Uluru) to Sydney on Sunday 9th February. The conditions coming into Sydney were absolutely atrocious yet the pilot(s) remained calm and did a superb job in landing us safely and smoothly into the airport. I realise that it is their job to do just this but credit where credit is due. I was able to make my feelings known at the time as the door to the flight deck was open on our disembarking, but I wanted also to put it on record how much we appreciated the skills and temperament displayed. Thank you.",Postive

Though they provide cheap tickets but when you ask to do any changes to the flight they charge you excess amount equivalent of purcha9a new ticket. Even purchasing a new ticket would be cheaper than doing any changes. They are not at all willing to do anything for the customer, they are only after money and play dirty tricks on how they can get more money from customers.

Joy (the flight attendant) made my friend  unpack then re-pack everything in her carry on because it was taking up too much room in the cabin. she made my friend pull out her personal belongings in front of everyone then has the nerve to say ""can you hurry up? ive got passengers that need to be seated"". SHAME ON YOU JOY FOR HUMILIATING US!!!!!!!!!! I'm actually extremely mad at the fact that I sat back and watched my friend go through that. I was honestly in so much shock that I actually froze up and literally couldn't believe what this SCUMBAG was doing and saying. Joy is of dark appearance (indian like) and is in her 40s I believe.

Also, when boarding they weighed my handbag with my laptop inside and said that it was over the weight limit so they charged me $65 for 3.5 kilos, absolutely ridiculous! I always travel with VA and I can see why people prefer other airlines than this terrible beyond budget airline. Never again!!!!!! I will never recommend it to anyone!!!

I was offered a slightly more expensive ticket (530$ instead of 480$, ticket 2). I accepted that offer. Being in the US as a German visitor, I used my German credit card. As I was told, it is company policy to distrust foreign credit cards. Hence, I received an email int that I should state the amount that was charged on my credit card. The company charged twice the amount of the first flight (that was initially canceled) on my card. No other amount was charged. One hour later I received an email that the travel agency canceled a ticket. In the email, the price of ticket 1. was presented. As it was unclear whether or not ticket 2. was canceled I called the agency. The call center agent told me that both flight tickets were canceled. Summary: 1. Chaotic organization 2. Terrible service for foreigners 3. One hour spent on the phone 4. No ticket 5. Wrong credit card charges that I will have to resolve.

A quote of $683.35 was provided which I accepted. I later learned from statements United Airways had charged $471.35 and IQ had their separate charge for $212, almost 50% ?? If that is a accurate commission/service fee this needs to be looked into and regulated because I can't imagine 'The Trade Commission' would allow an almost 50% broker fee without additional consumer disclosures. That would go beyond the perils of any norms in sales I know. Wondering now how much I would have saved calling the airlines myself.

We had a cancelled flight out from Newark to London and was told through email we would get compensation of 150euro each night for hotel that we needed to extend our stay.  We sent all the receipts afterwards and was told by Primera we would expect our compensation through within 4 weeks. 12 weeks later and we are still waiting.  I have emailed numerous times for an update on when we would get reimbursement but only get automated replies with no real update on when it will come through. At this rate it seems I will never get my money back since there is literally no other way to contact them other than email.  It seems a lot of other people are having the same issue based on the reviews here. I've had similar issues with other airlines regarding cancelled flights (which was way more in terms of the compensation amount owed) and all were able to get us reimbursed within a reasonable amount of time (Thanks Eurowings!). The customer service for this airline is awful.  We're always looking for low cost option flights from London to NYC as it's a route we take often.  We were excited when it launched, but unfortunately we will never fly this route or airline again as the customer service is non-existent.  Please sort yourself out!",Negative
5680,Absolutely disgusting service. Would never use again. Me and some friends had our flight delayed by around 15 hours and where promised compensation of €400 (or a primera air voucher for €450)….. this was back in May and we have still yet to receive and compensation. Their customer service lines do not get you anywhere and typically just ring out. They have no UK contact you can speak with and everything on their social media pages lead me to think they just don’t pay out the compensation. Steer clear!,Negative
5681,"Do not fall for this airline. To give you some context, I am not one for negativity. I am understanding of challenging circumstances during travel, and believe in making light of the worst situations. But as a frequent flier, I can tell you one thing: this airline single handedly provided the worst travel experience of my life, and showed me just how incompetent and misleading up a company can be. Here is a full recount of my experience flying out of Stansted Airport in London with Primera Air: After a long layover in Stansted, I made it to my gate with plenty of time to spare. When they started boarding, I got on the plane, put my things under my seat, and went to sleep. I awoke a half hour later to find that we did not take off, and in fact, they were having everyone get off the plane. The reason was not stated. Fast forward three hours later - stranded at the airport, waiting for some explanation, we learned that a part was missing in this old airplane we were about to board. They were reaching out to all the airports in London to see if that part could be delivered. They did not know how long it would take, but it could very well be later this evening that they would procure this part and ensure take off (this is what they told us). At this point, my one hour of free airport WiFi had long expired. I was using my kindle to communicate with my family and colleagues at work. I am a fellow physician and had a night shift to get back to, which needless to say I did not make it back in time for. But that was the least of my problems. Fast forward another hour - there was still no update. No food. No WiFi. Finally, Primera Air thinks to give us $10 vouchers for meals, which of course, we have to trek to the other side of this big airport to cash in. Not to mention the line to actually get a meal voucher is wrapping around three times over with hungry, tired, miserable travelers who had been stranded at the airport for six hours at that point. AND, they didn’t do anything to get us more Wifi time. All the while they tell us: if you leave, and we take off, the cost of the flight won’t be reimbursed. So where did that leave us? No choice but to wait. Stranded at this airport endlessly for updates when we all had lives and work and people to get home to. A flight that was supposed to leave at 6 pm did not show any evidence of going anywhere seven hours later. I found a group of four other travelers in an equally distressed state as myself, and we collectively decided to book another flight through Norwegian airlines to New York out of Gatwick airport for $650. I payed $180 dollars out of my own pocket to Uber us four stranded travelers to Gatwick at 2am. We booked a hotel near the airport where we got two hours of sleep before the flight out of Gatwick the next morning, which thankfully was on time, safe, and competent. It gets better - Primera Air eventually canceled the flight that night, and promised a baseline $690 euro reimbursement in addition to other travel expenses incurred during this nightmare experience. Thank goodness we booked another flight out, because that Primera Air flight to New York did not take off for over 24 hours after the scheduled time - I would have missed much more than a night of work if I had been relying on this airline for anything. After I arrived back to the US, I sent them all my receipts and credit card statements, and they informed me that they sent all my information to accounting to reimburse me for all my trouble. I was appreciative at the time and thought they were at least doing the best they could with a bad situation and angry customers. I waited patiently. Three months later - a multitude of follow-up email messages later that were ignored in full, four phone conversations later taking to several useless customer service representatives who stated with annoyance that they would “leave a written message” for the claims department as they didn’t have a direct line to call regarding my lack of reimbursement - I have not received any of the reimbursement that they promised me on May 14th, 2018. Again, DO NOT fall for this airlines. In my experience, they lure customers with fake low prices, cause them a miserable experience, and make promises that they do not follow through on. Dear Primera Air, Please do not ignore customers you majorly inconvenienced after you promised them a reimbursement. Please do not continue to disrespect and disregard customers under the false pretense of cheap prices, knowing your incompetence will cost them a hell of a lot more than booking with a reliable company. I’ll accept the 1330 Euros you promised me any day now.",Negative
5682,"This is the most disgusting airline existing on this planet. I had been due on a flight to Malaga  back in May 2018 and encountered a 23 hours delay. Since then I have been trying to make a claim for compensation to which I am rightfully entitled to without any luck. Their customer claims line ignores pretty much any kind of communication made to them, the ignorance is just beyond me. Instead of trying to resolve issues and tame their already bad reputation preceding the Airline, they choose to widen the gap of dissatisfaction. Because Primera Air chooses not to communicate with Passengers and rather close their eyes and ears to ongoing issues, I have now gotten in contact with the Passenger Civil Aviation Authority for a further resolution and hoping to get a result through an official Authority.",Negative
5683,"Had a scheduled flight from Paris to Boston last month (July 2018) that was canceled 6 hours before departure. When we were initially notified via email, we came to realize that the only communication available was via email (no phone number was listed on the website or in the email). We responded immediately to this email and never received a response. In the email sent by Primeria that informed us of our canceled flight, we were given the option to book on our own through another airline and told that they would reimburse us 1500 € per passenger. While still exploring our options to try to get home we found that the only way to directly correspond with the airline was to go to the airport. When we got there, they provided no assistance rebooking with another airline and told us that the soonest that they could offer a flight back to the United States was at minimum, two days later. We could not extend our trip an unexpected two full days in the middle of the week, so given the limited options, we had to book very expensive tickets with another airline. Now that we are in the process of trying to get reimbursed Primeria Air is now telling us that they will only give us 600€ each. Responses have been slow and only will communicate with us via email. They left us in a difficult situation with very few options. Horrible experience overall. Very disappointed with the lack of costumer care and communication.",Negative

They cost $400 for two one-day passes that sell for $99 at the gate!!!  They told us we could sell them, but who in their right mind will give us $400 for $198 tickets?  We did not know if we had a hotel reservation because the hotel told us we had the wrong number for the booking!!!  We couldn't confirm our flights with the airlines because that is the way it works!!!  I have seen my wife cry three times like this in almost 8 years, and this was the worst!!!  She says we will never ever book with this company again and does not recommend them even to her worst enemy!!!  By far the most stressful trip ever!!!  The trip cost $1500, financed on top of it, and everything was almost double charged and then booked through Expedia and Booking.com.  The trip should not have costed more than $1012.

Gate number came up as suggested 1 hour before departure  time and when we reached the gate we was informed that we would have a small delay of about 10 minutes while aircraft was being cleaned. we loaded and actually took off 15 minutes late. the cabin crew was very good. and the plane was really good for the price we paid. had more leg room than one I had been on 3 days previous with Jet 2 and was a lot cleaner . we actually arrived 3 minutes late as we had a tail wind . so for a low cost airline with so much negative feedback it was superb. did everything they promised . I also used the chat option on the company website the day before to check that the flight was ok etc due to the reviews. the colleague Ross answered my questions within minutes and was very helpful. Well done",Postive
5702,"I have read a few other reviews and it looks like if the plane actually takes off then you're probably okay. But if you have to deal with Primera Air when they mess up then it is going to be a terrible experience. I am going to make a very long story short. We began our journey and had a mechanical issue so we had to return to the airport. After hours in the airport we were emailed that the flight was cancelled. We were told we would be refunded for the original flight and reimbursed for new tickets to our destination. Keep in mind this meant that we needed to purchase same day tickets from New York to London which was around $3,500. The refund did come within a week. However I still haven't received the reimbursement. The flight was almost 2 months ago and I email pretty much every day asking for the reimbursement. I have been told it has been sent to the accounting department but I have no way of contacting them. The customer service is absolutely HORRIBLE. I get the same responses and don't actually get any answers. I would rather spend the extra money to fly in comfort and know if something goes wrong, I won't be dealing with a company that obviously doesn't care keeping their customers.

Nothing. 3) The only means of contacting them is by email, their quoted SLA is 30 working days but in reality its more like 90 days. The operatives on the phone line cannot do anything and the call times are around 2-3 hours. To finish this review off they almost certainly don't have the cashflow to payout everyone's compensation claims/refunds and so are stalling, dodging, not answering calls and doing everything in their powers to avoid paying out legitimate claims.

It has been close to 4 months since my flight has been cancelled and I have yet to receive any refunds. Endless amounts of stupid excuses are thrown at you from ""you need to ask for the refund via your travel agency"" or ""we are processing refunds slower at the moment, you could also rebook with us"" - whatever that is said on the phone is not allowed to be put in writing on an email.

We have been open to travel anyway with a changed schedule etc. but it was almost impossible to reach their customer service for a meaningful conversation. It made us uncomfortable travelling even if new dates could be organised - what if return flight gets cancelled etc.? You don't go on vacation to spend hours or longer trying to resolve travel incidents with a non-responsive airline - No Thanks!! Earlier on I tested options for postponing trip to next year - but they could not change our travel dates  because those tickets were more expensive. Come on, we are trying to help out here - you want to keep the money or not ??? So as we run out of usable options I requested a full refund when I eventually got hold of someone by phone. On this part there was little to complain about so far - request was accepted without any pushback, we only had to prepare for 6-8 weeks of processing time. This is the part I do understand and accept. What I do not quite understand (lack of insights perhaps on how an airline is operated) is why they are not stepping up the communication. It must bea  minor cost in the bigger picture and it means so much in terms of customer relations short and longer term. Lufthansa had months now to figure out by now.",Postive
5725,"Lufthansa helped get us out of a hole during the Covid-19. Wizz cancelled at the last moment flights from Lithuania to London, but we were able to get reasonable flights with Lufthansa instead. Not only that, but they put in a policy of allowing cancellations with a full refund up to 1 hour before the flight. The reason I have docked a point is for a couple of things: the first is that you have to call their Call Centre to get a refund of Airport Landing Tax for under 16s and this still has not been paid to my credit card after 3 weeks. The second is that a few years ago, the staff at Heathrow handling my daughter's assisted travel were less than professional. One left my daughter's passport on the desk and then went off. Anybody could have picked it up, but I made sure I did it first. He didn't notice on his return. Next two of the staff almost had a fight.

Remember Lufthansa cancelled it first without offering a refund ; a new flight proposal or even a voucher! So I cannot go to Lisbon : not now, not in 6 months, not in a year without having to pay AGAIN.

5778,"How crazy is shopping for the best airfare?! You have to be aware of how many weeks out you are, what day of the week it is, and even what time of day you search. Of course, if you run too many searches on the hundreds of travel sites, then you drive up your own price and if you don’t jump on a good price immediately, it’s gone 5 minutes later 🙄 I will NEVER shop for airfare like that again now that I’ve discovered FlightForAll.com. Since my son is in the Marines, we had to wait to confirm his leave and as we approached the holiday season, prices were steadily increasing. I accessed the chat feature on this website after spending hours searching. My first impression is that their customer service reps are fast and friendly. They gave quick and convenient flight suggestions based on my preferences. Even as I considered alternate days and departure locations, they worked with me to find the best fit. They were even patient and stood by on the chat as I was doing it from work and had to attend to my duties. We moved the conversation to a telephone call. They were very thorough in answering all my questions and explaining the process all the while continuing to be friendly and helpful. In a very quick and painless way, they had made my reservation. Not only did I get the best price available by far, but it was on a major airline that does allow carry-ons. From now on, I will be going straight to this site for all my travel needs!",Postive

5785,"Beyond Amazing. We didn't know what to expect as we used them for the first time. Our Euro train was overbooked, we got bumped with no guarantees by the train operator but EightyDays went above and beyond in giving us a confirmed seat reservation so that we could get on the next train without any further hassle. We almost felt like friends supporting us while we were travelling. Communication is fast and effortless and we could reach them with ease via Facebook Messenger. Airline check-in and seat assignments happened seamlessly. Honestly this type of service is unheard of in the travel industry unless you are willing to pay a super premium, we stumbled upon a gold mine. I will be sure to recommend them to my friends and family. If I could I would give them a 6 star, its been such a pleasure. Seriously, just book with EightyDays - you won't be disappointed.",Postive

5799,"If traveling with families and infant please avoid this airline. They charge parents if they want to book basinet for the baby, and in some other cases gives priority to sell those seats for a fee (for the extra legroom rather than infant comfort). The flight was late going out of LHR, while the help of Heatrow staff was good, there was no help in Zurich. We had a baby stroller and it wasn't delivered back at the aircraft gate, then there was nobody to ask for help, with little time for the connection because of the previous lateness we rushed with the baby on hands thru the airport. In Zurich for our next flight was already boarding and there was no help for families with children. The stroller failed again to be delivered at the gate in Tokyo-Narita, we had to carry baby on our hands thru whole airport again, finally stroller was delivered in the baggage belt. Confusion was evident with staff about baby car seat approved for aircraft use, while the flight attendant in London to Zurich approach was correct and we clarify, attendants in flight from Zurich to Narita was rude and was asking us to remove the seat where my baby is most secure because front passenger cannot recline, finally manager clarify and let us carry with the use of the baby seat. Swiss is not baby and family friendly airline. While the A321 from London was a fairly new and nice aircraft, the 777 to Tokyo was a bit old but clean. The call center is also disappointed, while I tried to book a basinet calling to London they claim it was not posible because all was used, surprise it was my baby the only one on flight, just they sold those seats. For the return flight I have also tried to book and they requested me 230 Swiss francs, when I asked to explain the charges I just stopped hearing the guy on the other end while still can hear some background conversation, waited for 5min saying hello hello and hanged up.",Negative

5801,"I traveled twice with Swiss air. Once from Amsterdam to Beijing (with layover in Zurich) and once from Amsterdam to Bogota (with layover in Frankfurt). Both times were absolutely perfect. The staff was really great and they helped us out a lot when we faced some issues. For our flight from Amsterdam to Bogota we got a change in our flight schedule the evening before we left (like 8 hours before our planned flight, we booked via an agency). We weren't happy with the adaptation (extra layover and 12 hours later arrival in Bogota), so we contacted the Swiss Customer Care. Very friendly lady booked us directly a different flight, so we didn't had any additional layover and we would arrive at our final destination around the same time as initially planned. Swiss is a relief compared to some of the other big airlines.",Postive
5802,"They gave two different people the same seat: 37D. Then changed my place twice. It was still OK, til they took my hand luggage (which is hand luggage fitting size) without my consent as the checked in luggage (with the reason that it was a fully booked flight) and managed to BREAK THE WHEELS OF MY PERFECTLY STABLE LUGGAGE...

5803,"London Heathrow via Zurich to Bangkok LX180 on 13th Feb 2020. Firstly, the customer services team are very slow to respond to emails. Secondly, the captain kept lying to us when we were delayed in Zurich. Telling us we would depart in another 20 minutes... He kept saying it over and over again. We were grounded for well over an hour. A storm, apparently. Worse still, was the attitude from the cabin crew who wouldn't ask the large passenger sitting in the seat ( 29A) infront of me to put the seat in the up position when we were eating. I politely requested the forward passenger to raise the seat 3 times but was met by a refusal on the third occasion. The cabin crew ( 2 of them ) absolutely would not help. They said that they cannot wake passengers who appear to be sleeping. I feel this was a mistake. It should be mandatory for all passengers to put seats in the up position during drinks/meals. It is just common courtesy after all. It was a very uncomfortable flight and a disappointing experience overall. I shall not use Swiss Air again and suggest anyone reading this looks for alternative routes.",Negative
5804,"After having a big problem in Zurich Airport, I had to cancel my flight at the last minute.

Now Swiss will charge USD 182 per one extra luggage of 23 kilos one-way (!), meaning almost a surcharge of USD 400 if both ways. Almost the same as buying a Business upgrade ...

Leo made it work and tailored our trip to fit our group of 11's budget. The other consolidators were pretty one dimensional and never mentioned premium economy. The only tip I can give you is to book early so Leo can give you the most options. The rest seemed like boiler rooms and Leo provided a more personal and a 1 on 1 custom experience.",Postive

5903,"I booked tickets for April and due to the corona situation, I tried to postpone them for October. Transavia claims you can change without paying any fee. But guess what, when I tried to change my existing booking I saw HIGHER PRICES for the October flights compared to if I book the October flights from scratch as a new booking. Comparison is made on flight ticket fare so it's 100% apple-to-apple. What does this mean? Transavia is practically taking advantage of an emergency situation to make higher profits. Such a company is not to be trusted. I have reported the case with screenshot proofs to the official Dutch consumer authorities.",Negative
5904,Transavia is not offering any refund for flights going to Italy which is now on complete lock down due to the coronavirus. This company has ought to be ashamed of itself for feeding off people's hard earned money in the middle of a crisis. This is nothing short of FRAUD. I will NEVER book or allow anyone I know to book with your business again. I will happily spend the extra money and fly with an honest airline that does not operate its business at such a low level. I hope the business lost to you through this crisis will be worth the money you get to keep.,Negative

5911,"I arrived at the gate 3 hours before the flight and plane was already there. The staff turned up at the gate at time we were meant to start boarding where they stood and chatted for 10 mins. The flight was full so was obviously going to take a while to board. 10 mins after the planned departure time, the captain announced we had a slot in 2 mins, we then sat motionless for 20 mins with no announcements.

Now a month later I find out that they phonecall I made to them of 20 minutes, costed me f*ing 90 euros!! This is more money than the planeticket!!! I wrote to them again and they said that they could refund me 20 euros.

5922,"Like  most of the other reviews, this review is 100 per cent negative. Transavia is one of the worst companies I had the displeasure to deal with. I have contacted the company ten (10) times trying to get the answer to a simple question. Can I take on a 55x40x20, carry on bag? They have a scam whereby with one ticket you can't take the bag ! and they won't tell you till you get to the airport so you have to pay almost 100 euros for the bag. At least that was my last experience. And I know it was totally stupid to book with them again. I gave them the benefit of the doubt last time and thought perhaps I didn't question Transavia enough. No, I am sure now I did. They are just totally greedy, incompetent, and irresponsible. Horrible, horrible company. Do NOT use this company. If the staff is like that, can you imagine how unsafe the pilots are??????",Negative

He offered multiple options for itineraries, was very knowledgeable about planes, seating arrangements, airports, & flight experiences, and was prompt with responses, both email and phone.

6178,The parking lot is conveniently located across the street from the airport.  There is no entrance and exit separated.  When return you have figure away to turn your car around this narrow parking lot to exit the same way you entered. When I did return and paid for parking the parking lot tended over charged me.  I reserved my parking online whice was 35.69 with all the fee and paid 14.99 upfront which  left me to pay 20.60. The tended swiped my card for 27.00 for 3 days . I had get a refund for the 7.00 because already 14 online he didn't ask before swimping my card. So it would have been cheaper if I had just showed up and park and would have been charged 27.00 versus booking online and being charged 35.69... I find that ridiculous to be charged more to pre pay.,Postive

6350,Always prompt and professional.   Very convenient to shuttle to and from O’Hare.,Postive
6351,"We needed more clarification on how to return from our trip to get to the shuttle and back to our vehicle. By asking a few questions, they could determine where you'd be exiting the airport so you know what gate to be picked up at and by who. We were picked up by Chicago Airport Bus Shuttle and then by Routes. This was not made clear when making our reservation and added to the confusion. Everything else ran smoothly and was great!",Postive
6352,We use this service exclusivly.  Always a great experience in the past. I booked several reservations for the local family to use their lot for our trip.  As always you park and they pick you up at your car and help load your luggage. drop you off at your airline and help unload. shuttles are timed so that i cant imagine you would wait more than a few minutes between shuttles. the only hiccup this time was i booked according to flight times.  only one reservation was charged and additional  $ 15 for being late to return which i thought was a bit stiff for 10 minutes.  they had only carry on so their time to the shuttle was  minimal.  the flight was 10  minutes late which left 30 mins to get to car with no checked bags  so if rental is 12 a day  why a $ 15 dollar charge? regardless will use again their system and employees are always great maybe just not their math?,Postive

6363,"This review is for Select Parking at Boston Logan Aiport, 230 Lee Burbank Hwy, booked through ParkRide Fly. I read so many scathing reviews of the parking options near Boston Logan, frankly they were scary. I wound up booking same-day because my spouse had forgotten to book in advance. I looked at several sites, and Select Airport (230 Lee Burbank Hwy) was ""sold out"" on some sites, but available on others. I booked Select Airport, and crossed my fingers. First thing to know, 230 Lee Burbank Hwy is the Hampton Inn. Select Parking operates out of the Hampton Inn, and uses their parking lot. I parked the car, went inside the Hampton Inn, and Select Parking has a small desk to the left of the hotel entrance which was staffed by a very friendly and nice young woman. She gave me parking instructions, took my key, gave me a receipt, and helped me get on the next shuttle. We had actually just missed a shuttle, and had to wait (20 minutes?) for the next one. There were free coffee, tea, and bathrooms available in the Hampton Inn lobby while we waited. The shuttle departed exactly on time, the driver was friendly. We took one stop to pick up some hotel guests at a nearby restaurant and then went directly to our gate. Despite the stop, it was quick, maybe 10 or 15 minute drive, not bad at all. On our return, I called the number on the receipt. I had to call about three times before someone picked up, but once they did, they gave me clear instructions on how to meet the shuttle. It came in about 20 minutes, we went directly to the hotel. Our car was waiting right near the entrance, couldn't have been easier. Overall a very good experience. Especially considering all the terrible reviews, really, it was a fine experience.",Postive

Maybe we got lucky with timing but the bus comes every 15 min and was very punctual. The ride from the parking area to terminals is super close and the driver was very nice. He gave us a helpful card with our row number where we parked (he drove up to meet us there), all the info on where & how we should meet for pickup when we come back and a pic of what shuttle bus to look for. This was so convenient coming from Queens to Newark, we will use this service again and recommend it highly.",Negative

Initially, this travel agency stated that the refund processing fee was $53 per passenger then a few days later it went up to $137 per passenger. This travel agency is just scamming people by charging exorbitant fees for work that will only take less than 5 minutes. They gladly took my money when they sold me the tickets. Now they want to keep most of the money for a flight that never occurred. Traveler beware do not do business with this agency.",Negative

Asked for my refund from Mango Tour and they keep saying they will request to their accounting the half-used computation of the tickets I bought but until now no computations has been given. Kept asking for update back in February and March they said they already forwarded it to Cathay Pacific, etc... Gave them 2 months because they keep saving due to Covid-19 they're getting a lot of refund request, etc. Now, It's been two months. Tried to email them to get an update but the email won't send for some reason. In that 2 months I didn't reach out, No Emails or Call from Mango tour when their representative Trixia Mae Grey told me they were going update me. This is ridiculous and frustrating!

6383,"I've asking for my refund since November 2019, but unfortunately, no action has been taken. So, I decided to write a complaint to BBB (BETTER BUSSINESS BUREAU) . Read what Mango Tours replied to BBB: MESSAGE FROM BUSINESS: Dear Mr XXXXXXX The following is the breakdown of the travel products you purchased and computation for refund. EVA Air International Tickets (Los Angeles – Manila – Los Angeles) Amount Per Person: $670.00 Refund Computation: $670 - $300 (EVA Air Refund Penalty)  = $370.00 per person *Unfortunately, per EVA Air’s policy, they cannot waive collection of refund penalty for health/sickness reasons.  They only waive this in case of death of passenger or next of kin relative. Philippine Airlines Philippine Domestic Tickets (Iloilo – Manila) Amount Per Person: $88.66 + $20.34 (Mango Tours Service Fee) = $109.00 Refund Computation: $88.66 - $50 (Agency Refund Service Fee for Domestic Tickets) = $38.66 per person *Fortunately, in the case of PAL, we were able to successfully request a waiver of their Airline Refund Penalty. Land Arrangement Tours (Cebu Hotel + Roundtrip Transfers + Sightseeing Tours in Cebu and Bohol + Iloilo Hotel + Sightseeing Tours in Iloilo and Guimaras) Philippine Domestic Land Arrangement Package: $2900.00 Refund Computation: $2900 - $100 ($50 Agency Refund Service Fee for Domestic Tour Packages per person) = $2800.00 *The usual refund processing for Philippine Domestic Tour Packages take around 6 to 8 weeks.  Our Tours Department has been following-up with our local hotel and Tour Operator partners in Cebu and Iloilo.  We were almost about to finalize the refund processing with them until this COVID19 situation paralyzed the global travel and tourism industry halting  any current transactions with our partners.  We are still prioritizing this refund and as soon as office operations in Manila normalize, we will expedite to process your refund. Mango Tours, you should remember this refund was initiated in November 2019, long before the COVID 19 pandemic, with Rose Cua, Mango Tours, Eagle Rock, Ca.and it's been 5 months. Now you're giving me excuses of the COVID 19. You replied to BBB of a refund to be given to me. Now, where is it?????? WHERE IS MY REFUND OF $2800,00 I'VE BEEN ASKING SINCE NOVEMBER 2019?????.

They claim they could keep a 20% service fee, totaling $175 of a $976 fare. It's not even clear when this service fee was determined, because it doesn't show up on my receipt. When I talked to their customer support on the phone to ask them for a refund, the person on the other end claimed that future vouchers were ""as good as cash"" and that I could use them because I would ""probably travel in the future."" Both claims are presumptuous and ridiculous. Subsequently in e-mail correspondence, I received replies from a different person every time. Each reply said about the same thing, with no intelligent engagement with the content or questions in my e-mail. At one point, they even said the quiet part out loud: ""we are trying very hard to retain our service fee."" In a subsequent phone call, they said they had refunded even less than they originally offered, taking another $31 off the top.

They stole $170 from me for a flight cancellation that was completely out of my control. And then have the nerve to tell me I have to use it by the end of this year or I just lose the money.

They gave us 3 ticket having different booking reference so even the 5 year old’s booking reference was different which meant All 3 had to sit separately. This was absurd for a 15 hour long flight and saw on return. In an endeavor to make more profits these agencies compromise on customer safety and comfort and yet the prices are not much different than any other agency or airlines. I would rate my current experience as poor based on above facts. Thanks, Amit",Negative

I have been looking all over the internet for a number to talk to someone but every number I find is automated which tells me nothing I want to know. Impossible to get someone on the phone. Book directly with the airline! Slightly more expensive. bravofly are a nightmare but completely worth it. The way bravofly is set up and operated is highly frustrating. If something goes wrong there are deliberate barriers to communicate with them. Very shady.,Negative
6515,"Wish I had read the reviews before purchasing earlier in the year.  I don't think there is any point in saying don't ever use them.  They have obviously taken the opportunity of the COVID-19 crisis to steal all the money from flights and have disappeared off the face of the earth. They have a bogus message on their Australian phone line declaring ""We are trying to fix the problem"" and then it cuts out. I will explore avenues of complaint.  Have a feeling they are a Spanish company, registered in Switzerland.  I seriously wish this plague on them.",Negative

I emailed, Twitter, messenger, IG but no reply. This is a lesson for me that do not book through 3rd party. I wonder why there's no legel action against them yet.

I asked for the cancellation and refund and was told it will be processed. 5 days later i got a confirmation email. 1 week after that still no money returned. After contacting them I received an answer that it can take up to 15 days. 15 days to return a charge to your card in 2020! When you pay your card gets charged the same day.

6530,"I have never been one to slander a company but I am beyond upset with this company! I purchased a ticket for my sister Olga Rene Zayas to get her home. I received emails from this company with my reservations and payment. During the month of July I also received email from justfly.com to let me know that I did not purchase travel, baggage or life insurance. My sisters flight was supposed to go thru JetBlue and leave tomorrow Aug 4. All day today I was trying to check her in for her flight but did not get the email from JetBlue or justfly. I finally called JetBlue to find out the the flight was cancelled on July 18 and that justfly should have notified me on July 19. I called and spoke with a rep who told me that they sent an email but sometimes they have email issues! I asked them to find a flight for her ASAP. The rep comes on and told me that there are no flights for the whole month of August from Sarasota to JFK. I asked if we could move the ticket to Tampa because my sister needs to get home. The rep told me for an additional 325 dollars she could get me a flight. I asked for a supervisor or a manager and was told they do not have anyone there. So I asked for my money back and then I was told I had to pay an additional 25 dollars to get my money back! I never cancelled the flight, I was never notified that the flight was cancelled and they have my email and phone number! I refuse to pay money to get my money back. I will be sure to let everyone know that they cannot trust this company! We researched them on the Better Business Bureau and they have 3 class action lawsuits!

The craziness began... called, waited waited waited on hold, finally get through and tell them I tried to do this online and it won't let me! The Justfly Rep tells me she can refund, never tells me the amount, but can't book it and to call back in 24 hours. So I do, call Justfly 24 hours later and wait wait wait, finally get through to justfly, their system is down, so she tells me I have to call American directly, provides me a confirmation #.. call and wait wait wait , get through , give her the confirmation number and she says, ""no mame its not here, can't find it""... so I have to go back and forth.. Finally I realize the refund is like 50 bucks and I lost that much in time dealing with them,  And wait the American airline tell me that bc they will be doing a third party billing there is a 50 dollar charge, so now I realize it will cost me more to use justfly... never again!!!

6543,"I booked my flight in January for Summer travels backpacking through Europe. My flight was originally phl - bos - lis - orl (Paris). Due to COVID all international flights are canceled. There is a travel ban that does not allow any noncitizens to travel to international countries. It is in effect by both USA and France.  The flight was officially canceled over a week ago by the airline. I have not been able to receive a refund. The customer service at this place is a joke. They have hung up on me over 5 times. Any request to talk to a supervisor is placed on call back status - which surprise, they do not call you back. The Department of Transportation policies states that if a flight is canceled for any reason the passenger is entitled to a refund.  When speaking to Explore Trip they say they can only provide vouchers that expire within 6 months. Due to school, I can only travel internationally in the summer. So I told them the voucher is not good for me. I am entitled to a. refund. They say that it is the airline's fault. I call the airline and they say it is the travel agency. The travel agency refuses to do their job and call the airlines. I have been on the phone with them for over 3 hours and no response. They either hang up on me, or they say they can give me a voucher. I have tried to inform them that they are violating The Department of Transportation flight policies. That if the polices are not followed then they are not allowed to operate in the united states. I am in the process of reporting to the better business bureau and DOT. At this point, I have to call my bank and try to get a refund through them. As the agency is ABSOLUTELY USELESS! They barely speak English and the connection for all phone calls is horrible. Between their static, broken English and horrible customer service. It is not worth time. Pay the extra money and book through the flight provider directly. There is a reason that their flights are so cheap. You can just keep in mind that if any delays or cancellations that you are stranded without any options. I understand that COVID has created a lot of problems with traveling, but this company is not doing the right thing. I will never book with them again. I would highly recommend that you avoid this company like the plague. They are not a legit agency and they are scammers. They just want to get your money with no regard to their services.

I didn't want to play their games anymore since they have screwed over a lot of people before, I imidiately contacted my bank and filed a credit card dispute and they will get my money back for me. I also have all calls recorded with explore trip where they confirm that I would get refund no longer then 30 days since initiated, which was March 15th...

We reached out to the airline who explained that they had begun the refund process, and that Exploretrip would contact us with regards to the refund. After not hearing from them, we called the “customer service” centre to enquire. On our first call, we were told that we wouldn’t get money back but could be given vouchers for the price of this trip. We decided to book a different flight with another card directly through another airlines website, and to follow up with this after he’d gotten back. After discovering that airlines should currently only be offering vouchers if the option for a refund is available, we called back to Exploretrip. The customer representative we spoke to was then incredibly dismissive and rude. He told us there was no chance of us getting our money back and, when asked what would happen when we opened a dispute through the credit card company, to not bother because we wouldn’t be getting anything out of it. A dispute was then raised through Discover who cancelled the charge. Stay far, far away.",Negative
6560,"I booked a  2-way flight with Exploretrip from Barcelona to Palma De Mallorca  back in January 2020. The flight was scheduled for April 29 with a return on 5/05/2020. On 4/14/2020 I have  received an e-mail from Exploretrip stating that the flight was cancelled due to Covid 19. In the  same e-mail they advise me to cancel the trip  with a note  saying that if I don't cancel it before 5 days of the departure date the ticket will be forfeited. How can I cancel a flight that already has been cancelled? Why threatening me that the tickets will be forfeited if I don't cancel a canceled flight? The flight ticket I bought from Exploretrip were part of a longer international itinerary with several stops, in which me and my college student son ,we were supposed to meet with several friends from different European countries. Since the entire trip has been cancelled  and with  all the unknown about how and when we will be able to fly  internationally and reconstitute this specific trip  again, I asked  Exploretrip for a refund. On 4/24/2020 I sent an e-mail to Exploretrip detailing  the reasoning of why I won't be able to use the credit and request a refund.  On 4/26/2020 they sent me an e-mail telling me to call the airline company (Air Europa) and ask them for a waiver which I was suppose to e-mail back to Exploretrip.  Very poor Customer Service considering that I bought the tickets with Exploretrip  and therefore they are suppose to take care of this business. The next day 04/27/2020 I called  Air Europe and they said they will refund the money and they will send the waiver to Exploretrip. So far nothing happened. no e-mail, no refund. I called Exploretrip several times and they said they haven't received no waiver from Air Europe. I have been sent from one party to another like a ping pong ball. I have paid 4 months ago for a service that I have not received, and this is against DOT regulations and Fair Credit Billing Act. I am very disappointed by the way they are handling the situation and of their poor Customer Service. I do not recommend this Travel Agency to anybody.",Negative

I have called and emailed more times than I’ve had hot dinners and every time they tell me the carrier needs to give them the money to refund me. Well guess what?! I’ve called the carrier (Aireuropa) too on several occasions to find out the truth and they told me that refunds are instantaneous and that it takes a matter of days for it to go through (so not the 3 months kiwi.com claim), and as it was cancelled due to Covid l, Aireuropa advises they are issuing full refunds. I advised this to kiwi.com, I even explained how to do their job and where they need to claim the money. I mean there’s a number for travel agencies on Aireuropa’s website which the woman at Aireuropa told me they should call if they are having problems.

Now is the first hiccup (one of the connections is late, which ruins the entire itinerary, and I went on here to check whether I'd ever get my refund... doesn't look promising, and I'm hesitant to take the instant refund because it's not in cash, and I'll have to book my next flight through them as well..)

I asked for a refund, I was then given three options, wait 6 months for full refund(which was not guaranteed after checking reviews) or Most of my money after three months(again was not honered after reading reviews) or an instant refund which was £30. After I chose instant refund I was then told I could only get this as credit. I would never book with this company again they are a complete scam and money stealing company. Government has to fine this company and bring it down!! I was told that the airline kept the money, I highly doubt this!!

As it turns out I could not travel with them because of other flights I had booked (Egypt you cannot mix low cost and national carriers). I asked for a refund and am still waiting (Cancelled January 2020). I re-booked different flights  (with Turkish Airlines and Easy Jet) at an additional cost and they were cancelled due to Covid-19. Kiwi did not cancel them and kept denying they were cancelled by the airlines. I contacted both airlines and they confirmed the flights were cancelled. Turkish airlines said they were refunding Kiwi within 6 weeks (09/04/2020) and Easy Jet I agreed a voucher, which was sent to Kiwi within 7 days. I have still not received any refund and it has now been over 4 months. I call and they say ""It will be back to you in a week"" 4 weeks later ""it will be done this week"". Today was the final straw and I rang to ask for their complaints team so I can sent a formal complaint I was given an email address so I sent my letter for an automatic response to say ""We are no longer using this email address"". Having called back the staff say that is the only email address they have!!

Who pays for our hotel and expenses then ? Not them ,100%. After this ,for making a claim we need a letter from them saying that they cancelled the flight and they won’t cover any additional costs. Same thing ,trying to reach them on Facebook ,they are sending us generic ,templates texts.

6700,"Without a doubt the worst airline to EVER exist. Had a connecting flight from Istanbul to London. Everyone was at the gate ready to board the plane (which was already delayed), when we were told all pegasus flights were cancelled. The staff were really arrogant and rude, did not want to explain the situation and were not sympathetic at all. 30 flights were cancelled in total, which caused a complete disaster in the airport, but pegasus refused to explain the situation or resolve it. After many hours of waiting, everyone was given another flight to take on the same day, which was also cancelled. By the time pegausus decided to provide everyone with hotels, it was already 3-4AM and pointless to bother. Airport had pegasus customer lying around like it was a homeless shelter overnight due to the incompetence of the airline. Will NEVER go again.",Negative

6707,"Booking number: 1519425408 I wouldn't fly with Pegasus Airlines ever again!! I'D RECOMMEND EVERYONE TO THINK TWICE BEFORE MAKING A BOOKING. ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE TRAVAILING WITH BABIES OR KIDS! I had my doubts about this company but i missed the ba.com sale and found a deal on here which seemed good at the time. £200 less than ba.com but I was made to book another flight because we were 4 mins late before the gate closed. We had our daughter with us who is 17 months. We had already done online checkin! All we had to do was drop our bags off. In short, the lady at the desk (Selima) said we were late. ""Doesn't matter even if its by a min"". I try to explain how its difficult with the little one etc etc and it was our 1st time at Standsted..... She spoke to someone over the two way radio but wouldn't advise we had a baby with us. When I asked her why she didn't mention we had a baby, she didn't reply. I asked to speak to the Manager. No one came and at this point I knew i had to pay for another flight so I said just get me on another flight as we were only away for 4 days. i had to pay £379.20 on the spot. Didn't accept Credit card! Customer Service was shocking! Not once did i shout! You can check any CCTV camera from the day. Maybe that's why i was made to pay. When the Manager came down eventually (Charlotte). One of the first things she said was.""Sorry i didn't know you had a baby with you""! All one very big joke! Pegasus Airlines is a fraud!",Negative
6708,Zero customer support. Old planes with very little legroom. They would not give me a glass of water during the flight. I could buy a small bottle for 2 euros. Pretty sure that's illegal in the EU. If you decide to fly this horrorshow of an airline plan to be at the airport 2 hours before your flight. They literally shut up shop and go home 1 hour before the flight time! If there's any problem with your boarding pass etc. You will be forced to miss your flight. They will treat you like you are dirt. Not help you. Threaten to call security if you insist on them doing their job. If you complain they will just say 'too bad'. Totally ruthless uncaring unfriendly money grubbing nightmare company.  Spend the extra money and go with a decent airline. Also istanbul is without doubt the grubbiest nastiest airport i have ever been to. Avoid like the plague,Negative

I’ve had to make an application via the website on the Contact us - Write To Us option and he has said I will be contacted within 2 days and not to worry. Fingers crossed all goes well and I’ll be flying with Pegasus to turkey next years  when my mum recovers!,Postive

Shame on this Airline, I will never ever fly this crappy airline again.Robbery in the skies.",Negative
6713,Istanbul to Athens. We had 2 different PNRS and they took all of the luggages under 1 PNR (which obviously means the 2nd one didnt have any registered luggage) and charged us 105€ extra without explaining the situation. They never fixed their mistake but just threatened to cancel the flight unless we paid. The funny thing is how it was shown in the system what happened and Pegasus Athens was supposedly taking care of it while their call center - to which we were emailing in Turkish - literally mailed that we exceeded the luggage allowance and that they never give wrong information. And that their supervisor said there were no extra people there that is why they added all the luggage under 1 PNR. Which was a lie because the people from the 2nd PNR were called to give their luggage and my mother was asking for their own group's luggage stickers which they never got because they had to wait for them to make the mistake of adding all of them in one PNR . So my mom received 8 stickers for luggage and paid 105€. Their way of handling these situations by literally calling you crazy and saying how the supervisors report matters more - and that you should use your legal rights- it's just frustrating.,Negative

6715,"I had such a bad experience with Pegasus 2 days ago and still waiting for a response to the complaint I logged as soon as I got home. My hand luggage (2 pieces) was weighed at the baggage drop at Istanbul Sabiha Gökçen airport and the staff said I should take 3kg out of one piece of hand luggage to make each piece weigh less than 8kg. At this point I was under my hold luggage allowance by 5kg so trusted the staff were giving me sound advice. They said it would be ok to have three pieces of hand luggage even when I said I had read only two pieces were allowed. After security I went to the gate and handed them my boarding pass, after which there was another security check inside the gate. Here a lady, presumably Pegasus staff, went through my entire hand luggage opening everything and checking it. She said nothing about the amount/weight of any of my baggage. Then the time came to get ready to board and people started to queue up, I went to queue too and was quite quick in the line. I went to the boarding area and the staff there tore my boarding pass and allowed me to go through, then I started to go down the tunnel to the plane and I heard someone calling a lot, I turned around and Pegasus staff woman with blonde hair was calling me back so I went back and asked her sorry I don’t understand Turkish, she wasn’t clear what she was doing and said it was about my bags, then she told me to wait on the side, so I waited and many people were going through onto the plane. Then she started to weigh my bags with a little hand held scale and I said to her why are you weighing my bags they have already weighed them in the baggage drop, she ignored me and then she said you are overweight you have 19 kilos only 8 kilos allowed, and again she wasn’t clear and I had to ask her what do you want to do? She said you have to pay 840 TL. So then I said to her what already happened at the baggage drop and that the girl there said it would be ok but this staff lady just said no you have to pay for being 11 kilo overweight. Then I said to her why is it 11 kilo overweight, I have two pieces of hand luggage that should be 16 kilos allowed, then she said no only you are allowed 8, and you have to pay. Then I said but many other people on the flight have two pieces like me and she said no everyone else has luggage that weighs 8kg, and I said but how do you know that? Then she said because I weighed everyone’s luggage. This was a complete lie because I was standing next to her while many people were walking past me with their luggage and it wasn’t being weighed by her! I said to her I don’t want to pay I was already told it would be ok, so what now? And she said then you have to leave 11 kilos of luggage behind. And this I felt was very bad as I just was about to get on the plane and there was no opportunity for me to do anything else. I said I want to talk to your manager and she said no manager, I am responsible and you have to pay or leave the luggage, so I went to another girl staff with dark hair and asked her please can you call your manager and this girl looked unsure what to do and then she and the blonde girl had a conversation in Turkish but then continued to ignore my request. Then the blonde one said you have to hurry up because the flight will leave. I said to her I was told this would be ok by Pegasus staff, how is it that the staff of the same airline say different things? And she again ignored this and just said you have to pay or leave it but the flight is last call now so you will miss the flight. I was very angry then because she just pressured me by doing this and I said take the money now because I don’t want to miss the flight or loose my things but I want to take your name and she totally ignored this and just took the payment. This ordeal took over 30 minutes and it really upset me. I sat in the flight and just wanted to cry and said to myself I never will fly with Pegasus again because never have I had an argument with staff in my life, I felt so bullied by the tactics she used and situation that she put me under pressure in. There was no opportunity for me to escalate to more senior member of staff, the information I was given at baggage drop was completely disregarded, at that point it was too late for any other option so I felt really like my luggage was held hostage, I have to pay or loose it. It was such a bad experience I called the call centre to complain as soon as I got home and they directed me to complain on the website. I would never use this airline again as this was not the only issue I had with Pegasus. 4 years ago I took a flight with them where the turbulence was so bad the plane started to go down and all the people on the flight were gasping and were completely scared and I felt like seriously this is the moment we will die. The pilot righted the plane but everyone was very shaken up after that and then the staff were just walking up and down the aisle like nothing happened and there was no follow up announcement so I wondered if it was just normal for them. I thought this year I should not hold the airline to this one experience and give them another go but the take off and landing on these flights were terrible, I don’t know if it’s about the planes as in comparison with other airlines planes the wings seem longer and bendier which I think really makes you feel you are traveling in thin air. If I could give 0 stars I would. I hope they get some serious retribution for their immoral and risky business.",Negative
6716,"It's a no frills cheap airline, baggage allowance is 8kg hand luggage and 20kg suitcase. Try to get checked in and boarding passes on both legs if you are changing flights in Istanbul as the transfer desk is very slow and inept. I didn't have any problems on my flights, I didn't buy much and my bags weren't overweight so I didn't have any extra charges, or experience any rudeness like some people have written. The planes I flew in were quite new Airbus A320's with leather seats. They don't have pockets so you if you bring stuff with you it has to go on the floor or on your seat with you. Personally I would fly Turkish instead since it's about the same price but with better baggage allowances. (If I now had to go via Istanbul again).",Negative
6717,"Wish I had read the reviews before! I have just got back to the UK and have been trying to claim back charges for baggage with so far no joy. I added 40kg extra to our baggage and then at the airport coming home very where greeted by obnoxious staff,  so rude I was shocked.  They insisted 40kg was free and my son had no baggage allowance dispite paying the adult price. Two and a half hours later I ended up paying.   But that was not before they called the police on me.  The funny thing is that the policeman took my side and the supervisor was even rude to him, disgraceful. I was told that no one spoke English in the international airport in Turkey and I should speak Turkish.??? I have learnt a little but certainly not fluent enough for such a conversation. But an international airport where no other language was spoken is that normal? They have no customer service department that will talk to you.

It is not recommended airline also, most Pegasus staff are  not qualified to treat the customers in a good manner. I think this airline deserve to the worst airline on earth. I have very bad experience with this airline today, the boarding counter stop me from flying to UK via Copenhagen as transit, they requested me to have a passport visa for transit flight and it well know internationally that no need for visa for transit flight but Pegasus airline are creating this own international rules.

6720,So far limited experience with Brussels Airlines as only just booked. To find baggage limits was great hassle. But to allow check-in only 24 hours before boarding is outrageous! Passengers may well have access to computer at home but not while on holiday - so where should they do the check-in. What's wrong with check-in 30 days before travelling like easyjet?,Postive
6721,"The worst airline I have ever used. I booked a seat with extra legs space on Bruxelles/Kampala, but was placed under the very powerful AC, which resulted in a cold that lasted five days. The tv attached to my seat did not work. Brussels Airlines also forgot to tell me that the plane had to make a stop in Kigali, adding three hours to the total flight time. On the way back I was placed in a seat with way too little leg space, which forced me to sit in odd positions during the entire flight. Direct correspondence with Brussels Airlines has so far not resulted in an answer. Don't use Brussels Airlines!",Negative
6722,"Paid for specific EXTRA LEG ROOM seats in advance for outbound and return flight. On board we were instead given the worst seats on the plane, that do not recline as near escape door, but the seats in front do. Also on the return flight, seats changed by airline and we were given another two random seats. When I complained to Brussels Airlines they refunded the outbound seat payments, but not the second, and this was done out of 'goodwill'? They seem not to be able to grasp general logic. Apparently they can change the seats if they want to for whatever reason they choose and your prebooked seat payments are not refunded. It is very strange. Specific seats bookings is OPTIONAL but we did it to get extra leg room. I would advise - do not book and pay for seats.",Negative

6725,"ABSOLUTE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER RECEIVED. THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS I have never been so disgusted and disappointed with the customer service I received from Brussels Airline. I took my flight from Edinburgh to Brussels with no issue, I checked in online and the representative scanned my boarding pass. The flight was fine, but what I experienced after was a complete disaster. My return flight (with brussels airline) was scheduled for 2 days later. 24 hours before my return flight I received an email saying that because I did not board my first flight, my return flight had been cancelled. I was super confused as I did take my first flight and was now in Belgium without a flight (that I paid for) home. I called the customer service line and was connected to a call centre in India. I kindly told the representative over the phone what had happened, thinking there was a mistake, they would apologize and reinstate my existing flight....BUT NO. I was told that I was marked as a ""no show"" for my first flight and, as per protocol my return flight had been cancelled. I told the representative that there must have been a mistake and that I was on the flight, offering proof, but they didn't believe me. They didn't know what to do. When I asked for my return flight to be reinstated i was told I WOULD HAVE TO PAY 40 EUROS. I refused this option as none of this was my fault and the representative became rude and completely unprofessional telling me that I may have taken another flight and insisting that I had not taken my flight despite me telling him I was in Belgium at the time. I asked to speak to a supervisor who also told me that they ONLY way I could get my flight back was to pay 40 euros. He started yelling at me when I refused and complained about the service. With the fear of being stuck in a foreign country with no return flight I paid the 40 euros and went to the Brussels Airline counter at the airport the next day to complain. The representative was very apologetic and understanding of what happened, and gave me the information to file a complaint insisting that I would be FULLY compensated for the issue. I filed a complaint and waited for a reply. A few days later I received an email reply. The representative again told me that the reason I had to pay 40 euros to reinstate my return flight was because I was a no show on my departing flight. I replied and AGAIN told him that I was on the departing flight. He was not apologetic, and seemed to blame me for the error someone made by marking me as a no show for my flight. He said I would be refunded the 40 euros. I insisted that I be fully refunded for my flights as I had talked to 3 DIFFERENT REPRESENTATIVES about the issue and was treated horribly (not including the representative at the airport who told me I would be fully compensated). He then told me that I was not entitled to a refund because I was marked as a no show....AGAIN did not listen to me in saying this was a mistake. AND THEN I was told that when I went to the airport, the representative told me that in fact I WAS ON THE FLIGHT and that the no show had now disappeared. This never happened, I have a friend who was with me at the airport who can testify against this. At the end of the email he said that as earlier confirmed (I DID NOT CONFIRM THIS) he would refund the 40 euros (WHICH I SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD TO PAY IN THE FIRST PLACE) and that he hoped I regained my confidence in Brussels air and would be travelling with them soon. ABSOLUTELY NOT. If this is how customer service thinks they can solve an issue they need a complete reality check. I emailed again (now 4 representatives with the airline who have been COMPLETELY USELESS) asking for the contact information of the president of the airline and am going to be seeking legal consequences. While the flight was fine, if there is any issue that involves customer service you will be extremely disappointed. The Indian call centre is full of unprofessional, under trained individuals who stick to a script and are not accommodating to the customer AT ALL. Will never fly with them again and will be telling everyone I know. If the flight had crashed and I was marked as a ""no show"" how would my family know if I was alive? Complete safety risk.",Negative

One day before her return flight, the flight popped up in her Google calendar (that she never uses). when I went to Brussels airlines counter at Brussels airport to ask what is going on, the answer provided was: What can we do?

The flight was cancelled due to a technical problem told to us right when I was about to get on board. I ended up jumping across Europe from airport to airport (Bromma – Arlanda – Munich – Brussels). I appreciate the care you put on planes but what happened after that was utter chaos: lack of information and organisation, they told me to wait for an sms on my phone to know more information, no sms arrived so I had to keep asking and asking and make a force group with other travellers to make our case and get another flight. Finally, I got re-booked on a non direct flight while other people next to me got a direct one. I had to run on Munich because the transit time was barely 50mins (Munich is quite a big airport). The flight from Arlanda to Munich was a lousy one, they did not served food because something was not working on the plane…Total delay: More than 6hours I do not fly with low-cost companies to avoid nuisances like the ones I had on the 5th of August. You are a non low-cost company, I paid quite a lot of money for the flight rejecting cheaper options because I preferred to fly with Brussels Air and I am a very disappointed.

Even discussion with station manager didn’t bring me forward. 5 kg in excess is about 1.25 kg per person too much. Yes it’s their right to follow the overweight policies but a bit of customer friendly support would have been appreciated. 314€ on top is around 10% top of ticket price .. too much for my impression and too greedy from TG.

It cost me less than $100 dollars of extra fees to get the baggage to Perth, flying from the US to NZ, then NZ to Perth, and $0 extra to get from Kathmandu to Boston. Thai Airlines charged me $55 / kg of extra baggage on my way to Nepal!!! How is this legal??!!!!!! I was stuck at the checkout counter, trying to figure out if it was cheaper to book a new flight on Singapore Air 2 hours before departure. I asked if I could buy another ticket, which was ~$300 USD, and they explained that it didn't work that way because their database can't handle duplicate name entries. Then I had to contemplate which pieces of luggage I could keep and which to throw away. So yeah, the cost of my trip tripled due to this insane baggage policy. When I got back to the US, I was unable to get anyone from customer service on the phone, and email responses were unhelpful and unsympathetic.

The whole trip was quite stressful The main issues: 1. failure of crew to help one passenger find a correct seat - too busy chatting 2. hot towels distributed twice before take off which already gave a clue as to how disorganised the crew were 3.  told ""run out of champagne"" after one glass as aperitif 4.  rushed meal service, begun with 40 mins of take off and before the aperitif was finished - and this on a 12 hour daylight flight! 5.  Meal my companion ordered was later found to be ""not  available"" 6. I was served the wrong meal - not the one I had ordered. 7.  Second service begun more than four hours out from landing - all cabin lights on for this, then blackout again after - and barely four hours after the first service ended 8. On requesting a second glass of white wine (Sancerre) told ""we've run out"" 8.  No-one passing with water at any time - had to go get it or use the call button.  Only one person seemed to be on duty. at any one time 9.   Requested water bottles - told run out of those too. 10. Had to ask for landing cards. 11.  No eye mask in amenities kit - when I asked, was given the cheapest plastic/nylon one 12.  No fast track card distributed for immigration - simply told you just show your boarding pass, but without any instruction that this is now in the main immigration area and not in the Fast track lane And this is Business class?   Yes, it was a mileage ticket - but that should not be any excuse.  An opportunity missed for Thai to gain an adherent.   We travel three times a year from Thailand to France and multiple times a year to the Middle East. Back to Emirates for us!   The Booking reference says it all: SAD",Negative
6746,If you book a flight with them you better be prepared to read through several pages of fine print with a. I booked an emergency flight for my wife (mother was sick) to thailand.We booked the same day. Because the return might be changing we especially booked the Flexi saver version! ReBooking costs 200€+ fare differences (not cheap) but still was the best option. Since we wanted to delay the departing by another 10 days we asked to rebook. Then tey suddenly claimed: Sorry you ticket only permits a maximum stay of 30days! This is ridiculous and we where shocked. There was nothing like this mentioned on the ticket. I checked reading every single word - not mentioned at all. Och ckecking online - same here not mentioned at all. even in the detailed description of the flexi saver conditions - only the rebooking fee is mentioned. After raising hell at the hotline and demanding an explenation the told me it is clearly visible during booking and can't be changed. (that is bad service). After haveing them guide me thrue here is what clearly visible means. You have to select a flight and select the exat flights you will be booking.continue to book but don't pay yet. Then there is a new button Fare conditions.There after repeating all the information about the change conditions etc. on Page 5! there is a note about the maximum possible stay. Did I mention the 30 min timeout - you only have this amount of time to read through all this information. If you are in a hurry and click next the information is gone - no mentioning on the ticket or in the email. you even don't get a copy of these conditions and even the service staff at the hotline can't get the information for you. That is ridiculous. You only get this information during booking. It is not noted on the Ticket nor email / when you log into their system. So if you don't read trough 40 pages while booking there is no chance of getting this informatin. I don't know if this is legal or not. it is as sure as hell very customer unfriendly and the impossible anoying hotline underlines this impression. I would say two stars as a result because they are still a good irline if you don't need to rebook or contact the hotline or just love to reat throu pages and pages of text while in a hurry.,Negative

There isn’t even the standard toothbrush and eye mask given, the coffee is nice but you get powered milk given to you by the rudest person. We were an hour delayed 2:30am approx leaving Bangkok and then when we arrived in Denmark at 8am we were circling and waiting for airport space. They don’t allocate families correctly with the bulk seats being given to anyone who comes along first.

No option for an early flight cocktail because it was a ""late flight""-10pm.

Tried to get in contact through multiple Vueling phone numbers (Spain, Netherlands). Not possible to get through and initially the phone menu did not respond to my key presses.

6776,"I will probably add to what people commented below, but I am really shocked with how Vueling is dealing with corona virus issue in Italy. I understand that airlines are going through a difficult time, but it appears that Vueling is going further than any other airline to save money. First of all, there is no sufficient information published about what to do if you have your tickets booked to Italy during the lockdown period. It is obvious that no one will take these flights now, but Vueling is not only not canceling or refunding the flights like every other airline, they are also not giving any option for people to chance the flights to another date (of course you can do it for their 70 EUR per flight fee, which would come as more expensive then the flight itself). To top it up, they are actually running a promotion now where they are offering to any new customers to get their flights with flexibility to change it FOR FREE, but those who are actually in trouble now are not receiving even as much as a reply to the issue. I tried to call them 19 times - did not manage to get through. Then tried to email them - there is no way to do that either... I posted messages on Facebook and instead of getting a reply to my question, I get dropped same useless link to their Corona update page which is absolutely useless and uninformative. I have never had such a terrible experience with any airline, and I take over 30 flights every year. My advise is - avoid this airline if you have a chance. 0 ethics",Negative

I am aware that so much of this is dependant upon the service provider which in this case allowed for full refunds.  Just wish airlines would do the same.

When I finally got a hold of a representative from Sky Tours they said they would not guarantee refunds even if the airline cancelled the flights and it would take 120 business days to process...sorry what? Half a year to get a refund? I understand it's busy times but customer service is supposed to be there to help - the attendant on the phone was very patronizing and seemed annoyed that I was calling her. Also, when I asked to confirm what flights were cancelled (an email update would've been nice: ""this flight is cancelled"", pretty basic) she said she can't tell me that and to check with the airlines instead. So...why am I booking through Sky Tours if they are not able to help me with anything? All in all, I would not recommend going through Sky Tours - customer service was sub-par and not helpful, simple questions not answered, very hard to get your money back for causes that are fully within your right as a passenger. Booking through a third party is supposed to be a seamless process - Sky Tours should re think the way they do business, because low prices can be found anywhere. I just wish I would've read reviews before purchasing. One positive aspect was dealing with Matt, who was friendly via email when I originally purchased the flights.",Negative

Customer Service was no help, claiming the card did not work and then later say there was a delay on a refund. Not a company I would recommend for anyone that is counting on a flight.

This was sent before the 7 day ""urgent"" timing but I then submitted another requests on the 15th, 5 days before my flight, and I am still now waiting for one of their agents to respond ""shortly"" to this date. I eventually got tired with this subpar customer service and contacted the airline, KLM, directly instead and was able to get a response. The response was that they can't do anything unless the 3rd party that booked the ticket, Sky-tours, contacted them directly. Excellent.

6833,Okay a couple of days ago I did a review on this business. I gave them a one star because they charged my card and I didn’t get any boarding passes or email confirming any flight booked I panicked because my dad passed away and I was trying to have everything ready from o e day to another. 4 hours later and after I tried calling several times and had no success because they work certain hours. I emailed them several times I kept on getting a response to be patient they apparently have to wait because we book through them then they book apart from the airlines. At this time the flight I wanted was $398.00usd on the oficial website with them I paid $146.00usd well long story short I had to wait but I did receive my flight bookings in a letter formatted email with just the number to the reservation I called and confirmed it because it wouldn’t show up if I just looked it up on the websites it takes a while for the database to update so you can’t confirm them right away online but yes!!! They are real they’re not a scam. I would recommend those of you trying to book immediately like I was to not do it this can add some stress to your life but to those who are booking at least two days in advance to go ahead. Like I said communication sucks they don’t have a number to call after hours. And emailing them takes them about 30 minutes to reply back. Communication stinks but they’re real they have good offers and they won’t take your money. I wrote a bad review for them thinking they’d scam me but it didn’t happen. What freaked me out the most was me looking at the reviews after my purchase. Many people say bad things about them. But I’m my case I wasn’t scammed it took a while but I got what I needed. Thanks not a 5 star review but I’d say three pardon my previous review and I’m not going to remove it just so you guys know I’m a real customer who two days prior to today I wrote a bad review with the worst thing in my head small companies also deserve a chance not just big airlines.

Airasia also closed the cases of my refund on my BIG membership account despite that no progress or refund has been made.

It is not May 2020, and I have made contact with Airasia again, this time they are promising up to 16 weeks to process the refund. Let's see!!

On February 28th 2020 Air Asia cancelled my flight and rescheduled on a later flight this was not any use to me as the later flight would have impacted my onward travel plans from Udon Thani. I elected to take a refund - this I requested on 28th February. Since that day I have been chasing Air Asia for my refund of around €300. Today has been the final straw for me - all my cases logged against my account have disappeared from their website and when I use their AVA tool to check status I receive a message that the Case and email do not match. No one in this organisation takes responsibility for ensuring customer satisfaction - have sent twitter messages and feel they simply copy and paste standard responses. Come on Air Asia - you cancelled my flight, this all happened before the global melt down in air travel and I am out of pocket twice as I had to buy tickets with an other carrier.",Negative

A travel ban is also imposed on all Malaysians traveling overseas and foreign visitors entering Malaysia effective 18 March 2020 to 31 March 2020. AirAsia is complying with this directive and we regret to inform you that your flight AK885 has been affected"". So, when they accepted my booking on 21 March, 3 days after the travel ban, they must have known about the Malaysia travel ban and that they could not provide the flight. Yet they still accepted my booking. Surely this is dishonest and fraud? I requested a refund via AVA and they accepted my request for a refund. Now they they are saying they will provide credit for a future flight. I do not want a credit, I want the refund Air AsiaA originally promised.

6859,"Jetblue doesn't deserve to be in business. Jetblue doesn't have any control over its flying crew nor does it have any respect whatsoever towards its clients. On Aug. 3, we were booked on flight 357, 6:45pm departure inbound to Dulles International Airport. From 5pm until 1:05am, on Aug. 4, we started receiving messages announcing delays to flight 357 and, at the same time, stating to be working hard (I would guarantee that they were hardly working) to make short our delay. The reason for the delay was weather related according to Kat, a CS Representative I spoke to from Help Service, and to absence of crew according to John who was making announcements at Gate C-8. Nothing happened instead the delayed boarding became changing from 11:51pm, to 12:30am, to 11:45pm to 11:32pm, to no posting at all on the board at the gate. From there is no pilot to fligjt attendant #2 is not there, no agent was well informed yet to tell us the truth. John announced the flight attendant #2 was two hours away, therefore the flight may be cancelled and passengers refunded or it may be delayed much longer. John ended up leaving and was replaced by Paul. The latter offered water and pretzel to apologize... To make a long story short, jetblue does not care about customers, it cares about money. (As I am writing this review, a new message just popped up announcing the departure for 12:59am)! Once on board, the talked about an engine that a problem (overheating), and added that wasn't a big issue for, once in the air, the engine should cool down. This way of treating passengers does not give a good image of the compny. It's people who make a company grow and not the othee way around. ""Client is a king"" as a French saying goes. But, for jetblue, ""client is just a source of making money and nothing more. After this nightmare experience, we have decided my family and I not to fly jetblue any longer.",Negative
6860,They cancel with little or no regard to passengers. This last week JB sent a notice to be at JFK a least 2 hours before the flight. For a change I did. Guess what happens? JB calls me to tell me about my flight being canceled 1 hour and 50 minutes before take off. So I'm standing in the airport when they called. No chance to book with anyone else at a reasonable price because they were already booked by other airline passengers who were notified earlier in the day. So effectively they locked me into waiting until the next NIGHT at 11:30. The real disturbing thing is one of their employees said it was an out of service plane then  another with the weather than another with an out of service plane. Since JB has their earliest flight aircraft fueled cleaned and inspected the night before how would they not know about the plane having problems. I had to beg for a seat on Delta which cost $920.82 one way. I had to get to Jacksonville because a moving van was waiting for me to move back to NY. I'm going to speak with them first then cancel my last 118 days of credit card purchases. I want my money back. Once again they lost a ton of money in the last quarter because they don't have a clue.

I called 1800 CheapOair and a representative told me that the airline (jet blue) made the changes and they were trying to reach me on Dec 30 by phone to communicate the changes... that I never request by the way.

Once in JFK, I went to check the flight status in the counter of Turkish airline (JB partner) and the representative asked me if we were travelling with luggage's because the system showed 0 - cero -  luggage's.

When I got to the front desk to ask what the next steps were, the check in desk refused any responsibility on behalf of the company to help or advise me and tell me to go and ring my travel agent instead. After about five painful hours as a go-between between JetBlue checkin desk and my travel agent, I attempt to check in to a replacement flight supposedly booked by JetBlue only to find out that they have not paid for it, and that I was expected to pay 55,000 pesos to get on the replacement plane. For any questions I had about this procedure, JetBlue check in desk provided me with a phone number that didn't work, and no alternative was provided when questioned. After 6 hours of confusion and absolutely no help from Jet Blue, I found a kind man from rival company Ibera, who actually understood the whole process and was happy to FINALLY explain what I needed to do to get on the plane without having to pay 55,000 pesos. Oh, and then for one last hurdle JetBlue told me that the only way for me to get home that was approved by JetBlue head office was a three change two and a bit Day long extravaganza that included an evening in a Fort Lauderdale hotel. Luckily I informed them that this option arrived in London 25 hours later than the one that my mother had found earlier by using Google. The only saving grace of JetBlue was their lovely staff in the back office in the airport, who listened to what I had already figured out and then acted incredibly quickly, apologising for everything that had happened in the past 12 hours. But ultimately, the only reason that I am home is because I asked someone from a rival airline to help me.

So no it was not comfortable night flight. The food was served 2 hours after take off by then passengers tired and sleepy. Then they rushed us through the meal before one can finish they wanted to clear it and they rush the coffee tea service and ice cream. I had to ask for an amenity bag which i thought SQ gives out to all on night flight. Breakfast was once again a rushed affair. The items was cold - cold muffin and cold hard bread terrible. Coffee temp was lukewarm only. Service throughout flight was pretty mechanical and cold. So i think SQ is not hit or miss depends on the set of crew one gets. The one i got for this flight was so robotic even military like (from the male flight attendant). Sorry SQ this flight not up to your usual standards.

However, the staff allowed another passenger to come and directly hassle me to change seats after he had finished hassling them, to which I replied no, that's not how it works these days.

Second, there was a constant drip from the ceiling, if this is not already annoying enough on an 8 hour flight it was extremely concerning from a safety and maintenance perspective. Where is the water coming from and how is it getting in? Finally, I reported these concerns to customer service. They responded to me 24 hours later saying they were sorry about my bad experience. They essentially said that the customer service issue was what they normally did. Really? Perhaps we could have some of the staff wages deducted from our flight whenever we're required to do something like that. They also completely ignored the drip from the ceiling. I followed them up on this for a response and they did not even bother to respond. They did not offer any form of compensation at all. Every other aspect of the flight was average at best.

After many minutes of researching, she came back with a different attitude (presumably having discovered we were right) and re-booked us on an earlier and more inconvenient flight. No apology was offered at any time! We have since lodged complaints with their head office who have tried to defend the actions of their call centre staff and distorted the facts in their favour. Putting this inaccurate account of things straight, the company has chosen not to reply which reflects their in excusable customer service attitude.

6908,Everyone told us how amazing Singapore airlines is and the excellent customer service. Unfortunately I’m not sure how true this is and have received some of the worst customer service ever - even easyJet provided better customer service than this! They take forever to get back to you - every time I had to chase them for a response to my complaint. My belonging have mysteriously gone missing from the aircraft - I was told my air host they had found my belongings and left it at lost and found. So I went to lost and found to collect my belonging only to find that my things are not there. Having raised this to the customer service team I’ve been told it’s not their responsibility and they won’t be looking into the matter any further. Absolutely shocking - definitely won’t recommend them to anyone nor would I ever use them again. Looking through Twitter this isn’t the first time this has happening - interesting to know what kind of staff they have working for them.,Negative
6909,"I had booked my trip for Hong Kong to Bangkok on January 9, 2018 months in advance. I broke my foot shortly after I had booked the trip, since I needed surgery I had to cancel my trip. Ctrip told me I would be fully reimbursed if I provided them with a doctors note, invoice of the surgery (I am Canadian and we do not receive invoices), my passport, AirAsia account and the Case. I sent over 40 emails and spoke to their head office everyday. They constantly had issues with my doctors notes which I had rewritten by my doctor several times, he even called them. Their problems with the notes were things like, this sentence needs to be in quotations for us to accept and we need specifics of the plane you are to fly on; I felt awful having to bother my doctor with such silly requests. Ctrip called my house often asking for the same stuff which I sent several times a day, sometimes they said they received it other times they said they didn't. They simply did not want to refund me. I booked through another third party site for my Vancouver Hong Kong flight and they refunded me without hesitation. Ctrip has the worst customer service I have ever experienced; spend the extra money to book through a more trustworthy site. If you use them for your trip, do so at your own risk.",Negative

All other websites such as expedia includes this option. This is the first website that blatantly excludes this. It was stated to contact the website/airline to book check in luggage. However, when I called the airline to request for them to add check-in luggage to my booking, the amount quoted to add this was more than 3x the amount than if I had just prebooked check-in luggage with the airline.

6923,"Good day CEO of Spirit Airlines,  Ted Christie III. My name is Dr. Allison Haughton, a board certified pediatrician in Orlando Florida. I am contacting you directly to make you aware of my horrific experience with your airline on Saturday July 6, 2019. My confirmation number is JGZDGA. There were 3 passengers, myself, and my twins,  one of them a wheelchair passenger, Jordan Green. I flew to Jamaica to celebrate my 50th birthday on July 3. My experience with your airline turned a memorable occasion into a horrific nightmare. The  pilot was grossly incompetent. He told all the passengers of potential weather issues in Orlando before we departed Montego Bay. So why leave Jamaica without refueling the plane? The plane should have left with a full tank knowing there are potential delays ahead. That is my first complaint re the incompetency of the pilot. The flight is 1 hour 42 minutes yet when we had to circle around before our descent into Orlando, the pilot said we have to divert to the closest airport because the plane was low on fuel. So the pilot says we are flying to Fort Lauderdale. At least they have a hub there. But he should have known that there are only 2 runways open. 1 runway is closed. Why not fly us to Tampa or Jacksonville? But a few minutes into that plan, the pilot announces we have to fly to Miami as there are no free runways to land this aircraft on. He should have know that. Today I spoke with a senior pilot that has flown for United Airlines for over a decade. Obviously there is a fuel issue here and a lack of competency of the pilot to make a dumb decision to land were Spirit has no hub and personnel. So we land in Miami at 6:59 pm and wait two hours on the runway for fuel, paperwork, and for the Orlando International Airport to reopen. Thew pilot announced that Orlando International Airport reopened at 7:30 pm. He said we just need paperwork and fuel and we would be on our way. I breathed a sigh of relief. I would finally make it home to attend the birthday celebration that my best friend planned for me at her home. Instead, we just sat there and sat there on the plane  Another 1.5 hours passed. The incompetent pilot chose to land at Miami airport where there is no Spirit personnel instead of diverting to Tampa, or Jacksonville were there would be Spirit personnel to help us get back to Orlando. A competent pilot would have a plan B. He obviously did not. If there not enough fuel to fly us to Fort Lauderdale, Tampa or Jacksonville, then have us deplane, then transport us via bus to Orlando. Instead the pilot waits 2 hours to announce he cannot fly and at 9:30 pm we now have to wait to be towed to an international gate. My sons and I have been sitting 6.5 hours all that was offered was room temperature water. When we were deplaning, I didn’t see either pilot or copilot to take a picture of their badges. We are all asking, when get off, what next? The pilots were nowhere to be found. They deplaned even before us. Cowards. Then the pilot lied to us. ""Personnel inside the airport will assist” he claimed.  Again this demonstrates the gross incompetence and unprofessionalism of Spirits’s pilots and supporting personnel.  They were SIX wheel chair passengers on board including Jordan. My son has multiple orthopedic  issues has severe scoliosis, ligamentous laxity, pes planus, hypotonia and requires a wheelchair when we travel. I have never heard of an airline that would leave their passengers stranded in another city telling them to simply “find their way home in their own”. This is quite shocking and beyond ludicrous. To add insult to injury,  I believe that Spirit’s reckless failure to execute a safe alternative plan to it’s customers has placed them in violation ADA laws and rendered them out if compliance with these laws. The ADA laws were violated when they failed to comply with the safe transport of Jordan and the other disabled passengers that had the potential to place their health and welfare in jeopardy as some disabled travelers are not physically able to walk such long distances without wheelchair tance. This is a clear and blatant violation and totally unacceptable and reckless on their part and in my opinion, should be brought to the attention of Spirit’s corporate offices. While no airline can control the weather and all airline pilots must remain in compliance with the time out laws,  it remains inexcusable, irresponsible and unacceptable for Spirit to abandon its passengers and not provide a alternate plausible and safe means of transport to the final destination agreed mutually upon at the time of ticket purchase. Spirit airlines flies into Fort Lauderdale, Jacksonville and Tampa. The dumb pilot landed where there were no personnel and lacked the intelligence to arrange for Spirit personnel and /or pilots to drive 26.2 miles from Fort Lauderdale airport to Miami Airport. Instead your pilots abandoned us 233 miles from our final destination. Simply Shameful. Update September 18, 2019 Spirit Airlines, the entire world knows how the despicable manner in which Spirit Airlines treats its passengers who have complaints. Do you think that ticket vouchers to be used in 6 weeks ( already expired September 10, 2019 ) will pacify me and make it acceptable  for you to violate Spirit’s Contract of Carriage and Violation of 14 CFR and violation of the Air Carrier Access Act? When I filed a complaint with the Federal Aviation Inspector and the Aviation Consumer Protection Division (DOT ACPD) call regarding the atrocities on Spirit Flight NK1838 on July 6, 2019. Eric Rivera, an inspector with the FAA, is tasked with investigating my complaint re the deportable manner in with you treated your wheelchair passengers with disabilities on this flight. Spirit Airline lied to him claiming that Spirit Airlines contracted with Swissport international Limited LLC. They claim that no passenger requested a wheelchair. This is a lie. How can my son board the plane in Montego May, Jamaica, in a wheelchair, and there is no wheelchair available to for him when we deplane 6.5 hours after? We were stuck on the runway from 6:57 pm to 9:30 pm, providing more that adequate time for Spirit Airlines to provide wheelchair services. Mr Rivera also claimed that Spirit asked Swissport International Limited to provide bus transportation from Miami to Orlando and hotel vouchers. I tasked him with asking Spirit Airlines and Swissport International Limited for contact numbers for these so called passengers that these services were provided to. He would soon see this was yet another lie from Spirit Airlines. There were no wheelchairs for my son to use when we deplaned. I told him unequivocally, that I was seated in the 6th row of the plane. I should see and hear the conversations of the crew. I also told him that my son had to walk 45 minutes in the dark airport from an unmanned terminal to immigration and that was the FIRST time from when we deplaned that we saw another human being beside our fellow passengers. Spirit Airlines violated their own Contract of Carriage and and US DOT 14 CFR Part 382. Spirit Airlines has been fined by the DOT for the mistreatment of passengers with disabilities. The FAA investigator promised to follow up with men with the written findings of his report and I will use this to file suit against Spirit Airlines.I will not rest until I receive a refund of $1281.00 paid to Spirit on May 1, 2019. Spirit Airlines has thousands of complaints posted on on every social media site, filed to the Better Business Bureau, Consumer Reports, The FAA and the DOT. I am truly bewildered how Spirit Airlines gets away with treating its passengers worse than animals and they are able to still operate. I am insulted with the offer of travel vouchers to be used in 6 weeks (already expired now). What is need is my $1281.54 back. I will fight until I win! I am just waiting on the official report from Mr. Rivera with the FAA stating in writing what he said tome over the phone, that Spirit clearly violated the DOT 14 CFR and its own Contract of Carriage for not providing a wheelchair and putting my son’s health in jeopardy. Then I head to court and CNN news! We have a facebook group "" Spirit Airline Sucks” where I have been able to find other wheelchair passengers on the same flight. Good luck Spirit airlines. You will need it when we all come together and see you in court. Trusting good common sense with prevail, Allison Haughton-Green MD FAAP",Negative

Then I realized I needed to pay for the bag, which I could only do on spirit.com, or else I had to pay high premium. On spirit.com I was not able to pay for the bag either. I thought that since the payment did not go through, I would take a larger bag with me and pay for a checked bag. But the machine at the airport required me to pay for both - failed carry-on registration and actual checked bag. I was very unhappy, but the payment did not go through again and I had to wait 30 minutes for a Spirit employee. Then everything went through smoothly. He sorted out my payment and I payed for my checked bag only. I also had to pay $7.50 to cut the security line because it was late. However I was on time and the flight was just like any other flight - the staff and the captain were friendly. Furthermore - because I boarded so late, I get the last seat - 39F. Next to me was the only empty seat on the plane, so I flew comfortably. I got out with my checked bag in hand less than ten minutes after scheduled landing, which is an absolute record.",Postive

WORST COMPANY EVER (ACTING LIKE SCAMMERS)BE AWARE I was trying to book a flight to romania and then every few minutes the price goes up and up which made me go quickly to deposit money to buy the ticket once i bought it the price drooped anyway, I ignore it and then i had a delay on my visa asked them that i want to change the ticket date here comes the disaster they said okay then they asked a huge amount of fee which I considered it as airlines fee however, you cannot change and pay from inside the app you have to call and then she asked me she needs needs only CREDIT card ., in the first place they were accepting anykind of available payment methods in china,, and then I offered a credit card i called agian then entered all info of my card she said sorry its declind and the second try she said you have no enough money!! I said its not my first time to use it! And then i tried do my BEST offered two different cards from my friends but also they said its not working as well!! What is wrong with this company(CTRIP) then it was late and the trip is in next morning so i said please i want a refund as you didn’t provide me the service and i did three credit cards! what else to do? And then an employee asked me for my card information with the code!!! Are you serious??? I didn’t accept of course and she said then we cannot do anything for you or you can get only 609 RMB from 7000 RMB !!!! I want a refund because this is too much  and they wasted the time the trip is already near and its not my mistake and this is a lot of money equals 1080$ .. and I am a student I wasn’t going to have fun!

6961,"Delta is my top airline. I fly a lot for work and personal travel and Delta is my favorite airline company by far.  As a rewards member it can't be beat.  Once you attain at least Silver Elite status, you are upgraded for free to first class if there is availability, as well as priority boarding and free checked baggage which is a HUGE perk. Their app is the best airline app I've seen and I've downloaded all of them.  I love that you get real time tracking for bags on the plane and you can see when it was scanned, loaded and when it was unloaded. If there are any changes to your itinerary you will be notified on the app and can rebook your flight easily on the app without standing in line. Recently, on a weekend trip to New York there was a delay with the plane and we had to rebook - we easily rebooked on the app (while watching 25 people standing in line) for a flight 1.5 hours later.  Our bags were pulled from the plane and mine was mislabeled (which I saw on the app) so I spoke to the desk agent who made a call on his walkie talkie to have the pull it aside and fix it.  I watched the app and about 15 minutes later it updated.  Fantastic! They aren't perfect - what airline is - but whenever I have been delayed (and it happens and I still gave the 5 stars) I'm usually compensated with points or a $100-200 voucher for future flights to make up for the trouble.",Postive

Just to be clear; ALL THREE cards are perfect (as all three always are). I called my bank and NO request for any payment was submitted by CTrip to either bamk. Why? This is the only real verification .... submit the payment to the bank!! So after hours of hassle over 3 days we lost the deal. Customer ""service"" were an absolute joke. Now hotel prices had increased. I now wonder was this deal ever real or just a scam? Tempt the customer with a really good deal that is not really there and see if they would then go for a more expensive deal. I beleive it was a  cheap scam. CTrip......DO NOT GIVE ME YOUR RIDICULOUS AND INSINCERE REPLY. You just do know how silly, incompetent, lazy and inept  this rubber stamped reply makes you look here.

It was a hot mess and the manager (Priscilla) at the Jacksonville, FL airport wouldn't come out and talk to the many passengers who were left in the airport all night to let us know what was going on.  The cost of the flight through United would not be reimbursed by Spirit. They refused!  But, the good news is The flight by United landed on time and got our passenger home on time.

7002,"This is my opinion just from recent interaction/ communication with Delta airlines. I recently dealt w/ Delta on behalf of family member.. Sky miles account was hacked & when contacted Delta only get recording to access account on line. BUT since account was hacked: a) password was changed; b) security questions altered therefore account could NOT be accessed; & c) email was changed! Problem with this also is: you can't get to talk to a live person! Plus what about people w/ visual impairments or don't have access to a computer? So issue can't be resolved because of any one of these issues. Finally contacted a person @ corporate office & even though it was/is their sky miles acct., no one would give any information out. So apparently the hacker is protected but the account holder isn't protected nor has rights! How absurd! & then Delta offered minimal mileage for reimbursement after dealing with the problem for 2 days. The sky miles points offered weren't even enough to travel around the block! What an insult. Also while travelling the passenger needed a wheel chair secondary to age & visual impairment. Well once @ the departing gate, the w/c was taken away; the personnel @ the check in desk left & never announced the boarding gate was changed, about 9 gates away. This was difficult because of not having the w/c nor seeing on announcement board that boarding gate was changed. Deplorable! Delta, in my opinion, seems to be prejudicial to any elderly handicapped person. How do you leave such a passenger @ a boarding gate, without the w/c & assistance, change the boarding gate & not assist them get to the alternate gate? I believe, again in my opinion, that is not abiding by the ADA guidelines. 1-10 update: now there is a charge on sisters delta card for flight ticket made from a travel service when she was visiting w/ me in another state!

She said that I dont have to go to another terminal since I will be flying out from Terminal 4 where we will be arriving.  I was informed by a Delta Rep (not Virgin) to follow the signs and I had enough time to go through security, pick up my bags for drop off, etc.  After immigration, I went to the check-in counter and was informed by the representative that I need to go to terminal 2.  I asked if my boarding pass says TSA pre-check since it does not appear that it is.  She said that she cant change it since it was issued by Virgin.  I went to terminal 2, only to find out that I am flying out from Terminal 4.  The gentleman at the Delta reception was so helpful that he changed my boarding pass to a TSA pre-check (which I thought was not possible at first).  I missed my connecting flight because of the travel time from Terminal 4 to 2, and back to Terminal 4 because of the information that was provided to me. I was grateful that I was provided an alternate flight, was issued the boarding pass, and to my surprise, I was placed in the main coach.  I spoke to the male receptionist at 36b and informed him of the situation.  I said I wont mind waiting for a later flight.  I also advised him that I had a medical condition where I had to use the bathroom frequently thus I only book aisle seats.  He said there no aisle seats but I can ask the passenger next to me if we can swap seats.  I also asked why I was downgraded to the main cabin when my original flight is a first class seat, and even not offered the perks of priority check in, etc.  He said it is because I missed the connecting flight despite me explaining the reason why.  He added as well that he cant find me an alternative seat because I am not an exclusive member.  This comment made me feel like a second class citizen.  He said that I can have a first class seat for the price of $1700.  He said that if I have any issues to address it to Virgin, however, my issue is not with Virgin but with Delta. I contacted Delta through twitter and facebook and Twitter.  To this date, they have not provided me answers as to why I was downgraded from a first class seat, to the main cabin.  Via twitter, I informed the representative that I am not asking for a compensation, rather I am looking for answers.  If they would be able to provide me answers to my concerns, I would be grateful.  Their answers would provide me a better understanding of how to book my business/vacation/educational flights in the future and will also share their feedback to the institution I am working and the profession I am in.",Postive

We had a very comfortable flight with plenty leg room, the choice of food was good and of a decent standard and the inflight entertainment was great too. However, the best thing about the flight was the staff who were fantastic throughout. Nothing was too much trouble and everything was carried out with a smile. A special mention goes to the male crew member who made a special fuss of my son, who even asked if we were in first class as we were treated so well. Our return flight was with Virgin Atlantic, who have a reputation of being the best, this is certainly not my opinion.

7016,"Used Delta for our return flight from JFK to LHR on 3rd December. I checked in online 24 hours before and chose our seats. When I arrived at the airport I had to check in again as i was told by a rude lady that online check in doesn't count. Finally checked in after queuing for ages, to be given a boarding pass with no seat number and was told we would be allocated seats at the gate even though I had already pre-booked them twice. This alone annoyed me. Worrying that me and my Mother would not be sat together. Arrived at the gate and sat waiting. The reps at the desk spoke over the tannoy and said that they had over sold the flight so needed 4 volunteers to give up their seats and fly the following day. Obviously no one jumped at that. They then proceeded to offer $500 to anyone that would volunteer. Again no one wanted to. This lead to the reps becoming more and more demanding. After raising the amount to $900, they found 4 people willing to swap. We then had to wait a further 20 minutes before being given our seat numbers and boarding. After a very long process we finally got on to the aircraft and was then made to wait for a further 45 minutes whilst they unloaded the volunteer's luggage. Whilst I know that this isn't the reps fault, I do know that over selling flights is a regular occurrence with Delta. After a very long day of travelling and prepping to leave, the organisation was disgraceful. Once we were airborne. The cabin crew were very nice, but the food was disgraceful. The only good thing about this flight was the leg room! Way more spacious than Virgin. However, this would not be enough for me to ever travel with Delta again.",Negative

I reluctantly accepted tickets for the following day.  nearly 48 hours later I was nervous that I did not receive any etickets from the airline.  After contacting customer service I was told that AGAIN the seats for my return flight for the following day were not available either.  Again, I reluctantly accepted a different return flight; this time on the day I was originally wanting to return... except these weren't nonstop like I had originally booked.  And now I sit and wait.... with all of my other scheduling and accommodation plans on hold... wondering if I will actually get the tickets I purchased.

The return flight from Cairo was schedule for 1650, two hours prior i am on their desks and one sending me to another claim is not me, or i finish... A guy asking me for money so i get first on a quegue... Finaly i give my passport and they say you are on waiting list !!!! I ask what you talking about and the guy makes a call from his mobile, later said is ok, and claims that the agent fron London put me on waiting..I show him my itenerary and he said i know.....I told him i have no agent, i psid fully and i got the ticket from their website.... Going on the displays it shows delayed 1725... Arround 1800 I am sitting on the plane and finaly we took off 1930....

7057,"If you book EgyptAir (MS), some weeks before your flight MS send you an email inviting you to upgrade for ""up to 75% off"". The link in the email takes you to their partner - OptionTown. OptionTown 'goes to town' extolling the many benefits that will accrue if you upgrade. One of these is ""additional frequent flyer miles"" but this is false advertising. MS do NOT increase your miles in line with your increased fare. I pointed this out to EgyptAir who replied that it is their policy and they disown OptionTown misrepresenting them. It's worth noting that you never get 75% discount off the Business fare (one way). When you take into account the base fare already paid, then adding the additional amount for the upgrade, the discount works out at more like 40%. Since most Frequent Traveller programs have moved from crediting miles flown to *revenue earned*, it is unacceptable for an airline like MS (who do credit based on revenue) to apply miles based on the original discounted economy fare paid. Absolutely cheap move by EgyptAir showing they fundamentally do not understand how reward systems work.. They don't work when they fail to recognise that they earned higher revenue. I can only assume that the Marketing or Loyalty department of MS is staffed with unqualified people. If you add in that their Cairo frequent flyer lounge which has  uncomfortable seats, snacks nobody wants to eat, and a refusal to offer alcohol for their non-Islamic guests (neither on the flight), travel in any class on MS has to be a necessity. The competition (Gulf airlines) or Ethiopian Airlines offering lower fares and far better in-flight catering and alcohol, it's a wonder that people do fly with them...",Negative

7098,"CEO Gareth Evans runs a predatory organization designed to mislead and trap budget conscious customers. This company is the most morally bankrupt airline we have ever experienced throughout our over 30 years of international travels to almost every continent. Aside from the rude staff, uncomfortable seating and persistent flight delays due to ""operational issues"" (see more on this below), there are many more serious problems with this company. If you think you're saving $100 on a flight, think again! This company will weigh your purse, lunch, duty free purchases, heck probably even your child as carry on luggage, right before you board a flight. They are trained to embarrass you in front of other passengers and force you to pay an exorbitant cost per kilogram for anything over 7 kilograms per person. They are intentionally quiet about this when you check in your bags and use the infamous 'read the fine print' line when they eventually collect from this scam. It is not uncommon to be forced to pay a $250.00 USD bill when the flight only cost $150.00 USD. It is daylight robbery and I cannot believe governments and airports allow this company to get away with this predatory behaviour. Jetstar is currently facing numerous lawsuits of passengers being told they cannot board a flight unless they pay these costs- that's right, extortion. They claim it is a 'safety issue,' and in some cases, they have trained their staff to call the police to block them from boarding if customers are being ""non- compliant."" One case involving an international customer involved racism against an asian pregnant woman. CEO Gareth Evans was directly made aware of this and did not even respond to numerous emails and letters. This is telling of his dictator leadership style and speaks to the corporate culture of this airline. The response cited the companies privacy policy and claimed they would 'look into it' with no follow up. Discrimination against minorities and workplace harassment is rampant under Gareth Evans leadership and in the year 2019, he should be held accountable for his actions. It would be interesting to see the extent to which political contributions have allowed this company to get away with these practices. Their customer service line is intentionally understaffed and outsourced in the Philipines with no ability to speak to anyone of importance at the company. They use this as a shield from the plethora of complaints they receive on a daily basis. The responses are generic copy and paste responses promising they will look into it with no follow-up. It has been systematically designed to remove accountability of the management team and employees who are trained to treat customers this way. Staff are underpaid and are treated poorly, but they are a large employer in Australia so they receive leniency from lawmakers. Jetstar needs to be stopped and Gareth Evans has to go. Until then it is BUYER BEWARE!",Negative

Dealing with Carlo was a completely satisfying experience, as it was with my own original model.  My bud and I now have models of the same aircraft, with the same tail-number that we flew together in VN--the livery is the same on the aft pylon, the nose-art is the same (in extremely fine detail), the antennae are accurately placed, and, from a distance, the model on the stand looks like a real aircraft accelerating out of a hover.  And the stand is numbered in our NW runway heading, the direction to which we flew most of our missions!  Carlo was attentive to the fact that the model was going to be a surprise, and he coordinated the shipping so that the Chinook would arrive in perfect timing with my friend's busy travel schedule.  Combining the accuracy and detailing involved in the personalization of the models, the customer service involved in participating in a meaningful surprise delivery, and the sentimentality of having a totally accurate replica of an aircraft we flew, I'd say there aren't enough stars to give these fine folks for their remarkable work.",Postive

Our recent flight to Adelaide JQ774 on 24 January 2020 was delayed for 3 hours and our flight home was delayed by 30 minutes. Got to gate 26 at Adelaide airport on time for the return flight. When my wife and I were boarding for our return flight JQ777 on 26 January 2020, we were randomly ""selected and asked"" to tag our carry-on baggages. Our baggages were weighed and just a tad overweight at 4 kg. The groud staff demanded for $65. I mentioned I saw other passengers before me with 4 pieces of carry-on baggages were let through without being asked to weigh them. So I asked all the Jetstar counter staff a simple question, ""did you weigh all the carry-on baggages of all passengers?"" Instead of answering Yes or No, they said ""we've been here for 1 hour"" I asked them again ""did you weigh all the carry-on baggages of all passengers?"" Their ground staff counter manager Belinda at Adelaide airport gave a long spiel about how I must pay $65, then finally said they don't weigh all the carry-on baggages, after I asked again. Belinda forced us to pay $65 by saying, ‘you either pay now or you don’t get on board at all.’ Seriously, how can Jetstar treats customer like that?Totally disgusting to us. Even after we paid the $65, Belinda’ attitude was still very bad. We overheard Belinda asking her assisting staff Matt and Ashleigh to watch out for us on plane, that they might block us from boarding.

When we called there were delays on the line, though thankfully, we managed to get through and found out we were due full compensation.

7119,I never fly with Jetstar unless they are the only provider doing a direct flight to my required destination. The reason for this is that they regularly cancel flights on you. A few hours before our flight today they unilaterally cancelled our flights from Gold Coast to Cairns with no other alternative. Thankfully I booked them through a travel agent who had to have a massive fight with them to book us on an alternative flight in Brisbane. We then had to incur a $150 Uber to travel from the Gold Coast to Brisbane. Don’t travel with Jetstar if there are other service providers! To make matters worse the staff were incredibly rude at the service desk. Their website misleads you by saying they put customers first but they truly don’t!,Negative
7120,"Expensive bag fee. Bags didn’t show up. Holiday in se Asia with nothing. Jet star did nothing. No refund in bags, just an auto response email stating it is what it is. Never using this airline again",Negative
7121,"Flight JQ961- passive aggressive flight attendants, when waiting for boarding an attendant came up to us and rudely asked us to weigh our baggages, they spoke as if we didn't understand english, since we were chinese but lived in Adelaide. The lady kept repeating herself as we were trying to get our luggage to the weighing area as we had two children who couldnt carry the baggages.",Negative
7122,"Smashed up our baggage, tried to get a refund for £200 case. They sent us $20.",Negative
7123,"Terrible customer service. Both my flight to and from my destination had extremely rude air hostesses, and considering my flight was cancelled and then delayed two hours (which no one told me when I checked in) and I had a baby with me on my own, the customer service on top of that was enough to swear me off Jetstar forever. One of the air hostesses even exclaimed under her breath ""oh for God's sake"" when a passenger asked her a question and the other one was passive aggressive to me several times, as if I wouldn't pick up on it. Never again.",Negative
7124,"After waiting 5 hours at the airport, our flight from Brisbane to Melbourne got cancelled. Accomodation was provided, however the flight the next day (replacement) was also very delayed.",Negative
7125,"Cancelled flights 15TH January my family of 4 were booked to fly from Honolulu to Adelaide Business class. I paid $9213 one way and the morning of the flight the flight was cancelled and we were put on a Hawaiian Airlines flight Economy class.The original fare was via Melbourne to Adelaide but the Hawaiian flight was through Sydney which meant we arrived in Sydney too late to connect to a flight to Adelaide . I had to pay for a hotel , food and transport back to the airport the next morning.We boarded the flight at 7am and sat on the plane for 2.5 hours whilst they sorted out mechanical problems and not even a bottle of water was offered to any of the passengers. I have tried to get a refund for the difference between Business class and economy but after hours on the phone and doing their Live Chat garbage they offered me $ 250 compensation per person. If my business took payment for a service I didnt supply I would be arrested but Jetstar keep getting away with it. Dont ever fly Jettsar .Its not worth the hassle Russell.",Negative
7126,flight jq 913 air hostess are so bad. They came to me & stood staring my food for atleast a couple of minutes & finally they could not do anything so bad ??? finally she said your food looks very nice. Hey Jet Star CEO why would you make your staff fly hungry. do you pay well. I had a small piece of Cheese + couple of strawberry. For Sure i would not fly with them again. if you go at least some manners or feel shame then i would say please do not fly with them. Yes the flights are clean & travel on time but whats the use.,Negative

7129,Please do not book with this company. Our flight was cancelled by them & yet they are still advertising the same finght for people to book. I have sent a complaint to their feedback page and 5 days on have heard nothing back. Pay the difference & book with a more reliable airline.,Negative
7130,"I booked flights to Tenerife in April next year via Skyscanner for my family of 7. They were the cheapest outward bound so I went with it. It looked too good to be true and it turns out it was!! Today I received an impersonal email saying "" Your flight has been cancelled due to operational needs"". They have given me 3 options. Full refund, rebook with them or they will rebook another carrier for me. This was sent from a 'no reply' address. I have requested a full refund and will await to see how long it takes. Sky scanner should remove any dealings with this company. I wish I had read the reviews before booking as I would have avoided!! My advice to you, the reader is, AVOID, AVOID, AVOID!!",Negative
7131,"I urge you NOT to book with Primera Air! I booked to go on holiday with a friend, and three other friends booked separately. When Primera Air cancelled our flights they gave myself and my other friend (who made the other booking) different options in terms of our next steps. I sent a total of eight emails and a message to an 'agent' through their online chat portal and never received a reply. I also sent a message to their Twitter handle which I did receive a reply from, although absolutely none of my questions were answered and I was given the same email address I had previously contacted. Two weeks later I eventually receive a reply to an email which was rude and patronising, asking me to confirm how much I had paid for the flights (surely they would have a record of this?!). Terrible customer service, rude agents and an all round shambles of a business. Do not book with Primera Air. I will not be giving these cowboys my money ever again.",Negative
7132,Horrible horrible experience!! I will never travel with Primera Air again. I flew from New York EWR to London Stansted and needed to change the date of my return. At first there was no contact number to reach them and when o did find one and called they just never connect to a representative. I called everyday and waited over 30 minutes then hung up because I just couldn’t hold anymore. Fourth day and still trying!!!!,Negative
7133,"First time of flying with Primera and the last. Disorganised,late.Cabin crew looked like they would rather be anywhere else. I paid for priority boarding but the gate crew 'didn't have time' . I have emailed them 3 times , as far as I am concerned they took payment for a service they didn't deliver and should refund. Time to spare fly Primera Air . And money but it doesn't rhyme .",Negative
7134,What a bunch of cowboys. Coconut Airways was much better. Six passenger  bookings cancelled. No response yet by email apart from auto acknowledgement. How did these people get authorised? Perhaps you Brexiteers are right after all. I hear Latvia is a mess and so are Primera.,Negative
7135,"Still hoping that someone somewhere will eventually get reimbursed, even after reading the abysmal reviews of many people in the same situation.  I estimate that there is thousands of us stranded, canceled and delayed travelers, with hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost airfare and hours.  Primera Air may end up costing us a lot more, then the minimal savings on the fare was ever going to even come close to.  Do not gamble with these guys, your money or your life, or the appointments,  or job interviews that you can potentially miss, or vacation days you will have to add, because they won't be able to service you.  If you have nothing better to do then meet people in line ups and waste money on airfare, then by all means - do give these guys your business.",Negative

7137,"Whatever you do DON'T USE THIS AIRLINE ! They are the most awful company. I went to check my confirmation booking/receipt for my flights yesterday and could not see where the hold baggage had been added. Beside the ""Baggage 23kgs"" line all that was shown was £0.00 so I presumed I had not got any hold luggage booked for me and my husband and so I purchased it. Later that day yesterday my daughter spotted online that the ""Type of Fare"" I had selected included the 1 piece of hold baggage but as I say she, like me, could not see where it had been added and paid for on the receipt. I emailed off their web site and the email bounced back saying""Mail Box Full, Contact by some other means"", so I telephoned, I was kept holding over 30 minutes and as I was ringing from Spain I hung up and instead contacted them on their ""web chat"", I got a reply within 24 hrs which told me that ""Extras"" was non-refundable. When I explained that I had not booked ""extras"" but mistakenly booked my luggage twice because of their incompetent receipt which did not show any luggage had been booked or paid for, they still said it was non-refundable !! So I have lost 50 euros because of this company's incompetent document. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY! If I had read the reviews before looking for my flights I would NEVER have used this company! Looking at the other reviews, I am now wondering if my flight will even TURN UP !!!   Like other reviewers on here, if I could I would give this company ""0"" JUST for customer service!",Negative

7139,"Sent: Thursday 28 June, 14:53 Subject: Customer feed back email Booking ref number. 0ZU40P I actually can't believe a customer review email  was sent out... After numerous emails regarding me being a disabled 1st time lone traveller, your speed of reply was shocking... But I gave u benefit of the doubt & booked my trip.. However then there was the debacle of flight/Airport cancellation, by this time I'd payed, arranged etc, so I again gave a 2nd chance.... I turn up at Birmingham (who's assistance dept was excellent) expecting a comfort seat, to do d it isn't even one of ur planes or staff.... Food was horrendous no coffee/tea was offered, no comfort seat even tho I'd booked it as disabled traveller!!!!!! To arrive at EWR and they loose my mobility scooter... I have to make my own way to security /bag collection etc, my cousin whom was waiting for me had to track down someone to find my scooter, 2 hrs later it was brought to me.... Then 15 minutes before I'm due to leave for airport I receive a delayed txt/email.... I then have to book a hotel until u get to airport for a 3am check in... Which didn't happen u til 4am which like a lot of customers that night left us very frustrated.... I then get no assistance even tho you assured me it was all taken care of.... Again not your own plane or staff!!!!!! Again  no comfort seat!!!! Which I paid for..... Then no meal which is paid for.... As a diabetic food is very important luckily I'd prepared for your inefficiency so had supplies.... So I was left hungry, cramped in a seat. I will never book again with yourselves, I will leave this report on every social media format I can ie trip advisor.. Etc..... The staff who weren't your staff were excellent under the circumstances, but no primera rep/spoke person could be found..... Passengers were understandably cross, as a lone disabled traveller I was quite scared /worried.... No one knew anything about my assistance needs.... I feel terribly let down by yourselves & wish I'd gone for a different outfit..... So no I'm not happy Debbie codd",Negative
7140,My son was travelling from Alicante to New York via Stansted on Sunday 29 July with two small children. There was very important medication in the suitcase which my son has to take on a daily basis. He filled in a missing luggage form at Newwark airport and was told the suitcase would be delivered in two days. It has not. As a result of this my son is in hospital in a very serious condition. His wife sent Primera Air many emails about this life-threatening situation but NOBODY has BOTHERED TO ANSWER her emails or APOLOGISE for the failure to deliver the suitcase. He paid over 3000 dollars for one way tickets but Primera seem unable to deliver a single suitcase which is causing untold stress for the whole family.,Negative
7141,"I knew that this was quite a new airline, which is flying from Stansted to various destinations such as Spain. After booking a weekend trip to meet up with some friends, I read the horrible reviews online and grew worried if I would ever make it to Alicante. A few weeks after my ticket purchase, my worries came to fruition and I got an e-mail from them saying that my flight was cancelled! They work in accordance to the law, and offered to book me on an alternative flight, but I was not sure if I wanted to trust them again. I instead booked another flight with a decent airline myself. While it wasn't the flight time I wanted, it was doable and almost at the same price. At least I can rest assured that I will make it to Alicante and my friends won’t go without me. Three days after they cancelled my flight, they confirmed that a refund has been given. I guess if they want to succeed in the current market, they need to make a lot of changes to earn the customers' trust!",Negative

7145,Same story as many others here. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Sons flight from Toronto to Birmingham cancelled. Given options of transferring to Stansted flight or a refund - asked for transfer. That was 5 days ago - heard nothing since - no confirmation or booking number. We've reached the point where we'll have to buy him a flight on Canada Air and accept we've lost the cost of the Primera flight. Astonishing how they get away with this - Watchdog - where are you?,Negative
7146,"Lots of bad reviews on Trustpilot my own experience was the opposite. Our flight on the 01/08/2018 from London Stansted to Alicante was excellent. Traditional desk check in at Stansted was great. No extra cost,seated together row 5 ,hand luggage on board gate number issued with boarding pass. With the exception of gate number most of above involves extra cost with Ryanair. Crew excellent, pilot route information and progress best and most informative I have heard for a very long time. Perfect landing as well.(Always helps) Competitive ticket price as well compared to Ryanair The reason I mentioned early gate number information,( as anyone who knows Stansted) they love to keep you in the Terminal Shopping/Area as long as possible. This can lead to a last minute rush especially with regard to Ryanair.",Postive

7204,"To whom it may concern, Im not a happy camper! Back in July 2015. I, Allen Gray, went online to search for a good site for travel for my wife and I and we decided to include our daughter in our 14th year Anniversary for September 2015. I vaguely searched and narrowed down, and finally I chose Military Flight Travel for our Anniversary Vacation. Thinking this site gives the best rates on traveling aboard or here in the USA for military Actived/Retired personel. Two months later and the day of travel, We received bad news at the airport. Saying, ""Our itineray and booking wasnt book for us to travel."" You all just dont realize the Sadness, Dissappointment and Embarrassment we were faced to hear, that US Air didnt have our vacation booked. Now remind you, we arrived at the Airport 2hrs prior to departing. We waited 2hrs to hear this dissappointing news. Why I NEVER, expected to hear this after planning this trip two months ahead of time. How Disgusted, Disbeliefed and Dissatisfied I was!!!!!! My family was dissappointed most of the all. While being in the military, the number 1 key factor is, "" Communication!"" Mis-Communication can sink a ship, and our ship was sunk. We were excited and eager to make this vacation trip, an enjoyable one with our daughter. We never received a call on the change of flights the day before our departure. But instead we found out the day after missing our flight on our 14th year Anniversary, that was planned two months early! It was in my Junk mail instead. Now is this how we conduct military bussiness with our Active/Retired/Disable/Veterans across the board? This bussiness showed very, very poor communication, too many errors on change of flights at the last minute. Now I can not give a good rating to a bussiness that was planned two months out. There is no excuse for poor judgement of character!  From a upset, dissappointed Retired/Disable Veteran!",Negative

So I changed it for July 5th. It's now been three days and we have still not received the itinerary. I have been calling everyday.

We have called Lufthansa multiple times since for a refund, and the customer service operator just gives a generic answer that ""refunds are being processed"" but they can't gurantee the time frame for refund. Not sure if the refunds are even being processed or this is just a delaying tactic while awaiting the bailout money. Read online and there are countless other complaints that Lufthansa is giving the runaround for refunds for months. We are just providing an interest free loan for them! We booked flights with Delta and Cathay during the same period and they refunded us within 3 - 5 days with no issues. Extremely bad service from Lufthansa!

7258,"So let me first start off with a little bit of background. I booked my ticket and hotel via Travellink a couple of days ago. A day after I booked the ticket, I saw that the flight was cancelled on Lufthansa's website. So then I called Lufthansa regarding the plane ticket and it turned out that Travellink had made an invalid booking (since the flight was cancelled probably in the same instance as I made the booking), so of course I need help in order to apply for a refund. For some reason, Travellink would not answer when I called them so I turned to Lufthansa. I was really worried and the customer service representative at Lufthansa explained to me that she couldn't help me as I had made the booking via another travel agency. So far, so good. I was well aware of the risk. After the explanation I asked her if she could kindly send me an e-mail (or any kind of written text) with this information (which I would be able to show the travel agency in case I would get into an argument with them...) but she simply refused, stating that it was not possible as Lufthansa only sends e-mails which you cannot reply to. I was totally fine with that! I didn't want to bother Lufthansa anymore but I just needed that written statement for my own assurance (the problem was that I couldn't receive the information she told me on-line or anywhere regarding my case). So I asked again, explaining to her that I just wanted the information as proof that I had been in contact with Lufthansa, but she refused. Then I will admit that I got a bit upset (I wasn't shouting or so but I was clearly not happy either) and I told her this is very strange practice and that I would never book a flight with Lufthansa again, and she simply hung up. It was a bit weird and honestly, I think that we both could've handled the situation better. Luckily, this review is not about me. ;) Also very luckily, I was able to receive a refund via Travellink and they handled my case very professionally.  Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for the customer support service at Lufthansa. So all in all, I'm kind of disappointed since we're talking about a very well-known airline and also Germany's largest airline...",Negative
7259,"They cancelled my flight in March 2020 and promised me a refund. I called them back in March 2020 and they said that refund will be processed within 5-15 business days. Next time I called them in May 2020, that time they said that they will refund me but they don't have an estimate on when! It's end of June 2020 and I haven't received my money back! That's literally stealing someone's money! I'm never going to book a flight with them again!",Negative
7260,"They cancelled one of the legs of my flight which is ok fair enough.  They have not put us on the earlier flight which is currently available.  Instead they just ask us to call a toll-number to rebook. I said fine... until waited over 2 hours in total, trying on different days, but no one is picking up. I rang customer services in Germany, UK number, none of the numbers are answering.  They are German government backed day time thieves.  Taking your money up front, cancelling a flight without putting you on another one, and never answering a call! What appalling scammers they are! Institutional robbery - if I made something like this, most probably the police would be on my door but if it is Lufthansa anything is fine.  I do not think that I have ever loathed an airline as much but as soon as I recover my money from them, I will never ever make the mistake of booking with them! The level of stress which they are causing is horrendous.",Negative

This was a bit strange to us as airline tickets from Los Angeles to San Francisco cost about as much. We asked a friend who traveled to Europe several times and she thought it was a scam too! We went ahead and made the bookings anyway thinking that the credit card companies will reimburse us in case of fraud. Our suspicion grew as for several hours after the booking we still hadn't received the e-tickets. Once we received our e-tickets, we went ahead and checked each individual booking in respective airline/railway company's website. To our surprise everything checked out!

7355,"Poor service. Hustling mentality, and very poor user experience. I was charged the same amount for my bag-pack today as what my ticket costed me. It’s ridiculously. That’s how they make their money - by cheating their own customers. Don’t fly with Wizzair!",Negative
7356,Needed to pay extra 25€ for the trolley that was fitting the the cabin. The measurement of the trolley was how it should be and still they took extra 25€ for it. Sorry to say that but the staff was really bad. I wonder how this company is still alive.,Negative
7357,"I bought the expensive (FLEX or something) ticket for 1 July from London Luton to Thessaloniki, Greece. On 26th of July, the undersecretary (one ""rank"" below minister) of tourism from the Greek Government went to news outlets and said that direct flights from the UK to Greece would continue to not be permitted from 1 July (they were not permitted during June, and they were thinking of allowing them from 1st July onwards, but changed their minds, and first announced that on 26th June). He also said that the official announcement was going to come out on 29th June. I didn't want to wait till 1 day before my flight for WizzAir to cancel it (and I found out from others that they ended up cancelling it on the 30th and a mere 14 hours before the actual flight), thus I tried to book another flight. In that effort, I ended up cancelling my ticket which led to the first ridiculous policy they have - it takes 72 hours for them to put the ""refunded"" money into a ""WizzAir account"".... why 72 hours? The second ridiculous policy is that after they added it I would only have 3 months to book another flight with them, otherwise they keep the money, which is ridiculously short even for pre-COVID times, it should be 12 months at least, and probably 24 or 36 now that COVID is around. I would have found that reasonable. But regardless, I couldn't wait 72 hours to book another flight with them, so I ended up booking with another company for my actual flight. Once the 72 hours passed, my money was added to the ""WizzAir Account"", after which I proceeded to try to get a refund to one of my actual bank accounts. In that process, they ask for the reason for the refund, and they have two new options ""Cancellation initiated by WizzAir due to COVID"" and ""Cancellation initiated by customer due to COVID""  - I picked the second option, assuming that there is a difference from a similar cancellation pre-COVID times, and thus that I would actually get a refund (otherwise what's the point of having such an option). Apparently, cancelling my flight due to COVID (a flight which was gonna get cancelled for sure by them eventually) and having bought the more expensive ticket wasn't enough to get a refund. They hide behind T&C and maybe legally they are ok with doing so, but personally I find this bad practice, ridiculous, and won't ever be using them again. I attach the e-mails that ensued after they responded to my refund request.",Negative
7358,"Wizz air refused 30plus passengers to board and pulled some off the plane threatening arrest if they did bot comply. Four days later they apologised for the error by email but have not given any compensation and have refused to refund for the flights. Do not use wizz air, they are a rip off.

7368,I had a bad experience with Mintfares. They did not get back to me on time. The first agent I dealt with was very nice but he left the job. The second agent who assisted me was very inconsistent. I got follow up emails when I already gave her a time to get back to me and she didn't. Another agent called me on her behalf when I had asked for only one agent to assist me throughout the process. I was contacted by the previous agent a few days back and she kept saying she would call and never got back to me. When I expressed my disappointment she had all the time in the world to continuously text me instead of calling and apologizing and offering a deal. I couldn't trust them enough to book with them. The other reviews are good but my experience wasn't good at all. **this is an update. Their supervisor got back to me immediately after this and tried his best to resolve the issue. This does demonstrate that Mintfares truly cares about their customers. He was very helpful and tried his best for over an hour trying to get me the best possible deal and I truly appreciate when supervisors such as him take responsibility for the actions of their team. Mistakes happen but I surely am not dissatisfied as he tried his best. I still have a budget and have not purchased the ticket as I couldn't find it within the budget. But I hope to be able to book with him in particular in future. I'm impressed with how seriously some of them take their customers. So for those of you out there... this is a great option to purchase tickets. Especially from Aman. :),Postive

7376,"Hi, I had a flight from Euroairport Basel/Mulhouse on 02/07/2020  with my two children aged of 18 months and 3 years. Before the trip i chequed up the rules of travelling to Skopje/Macédonia concerning the COVID- 19. The rules where that every Macedonian citizen ( wich i am) going to his country even with his two children citizen of the Eu( France ) is accepted to enter in Macedonia. On the check in desk the personal of the airport refused to check me and m’y children saying that my kids couldn’t enter Macedonia because they are french and they wont take the risk to pay for a return flight. In the following minutes i called the ministry of Macedonia wich confirmes me that we can enter Macedonia and than go back to France.... The personal refuses. I go to the french police that says that i can leave the country with no problem but that your company makes this for money.... I even made the Pcr COVID-19 test I wasn’t the only one in the same case. The chief of the airport wrote to you and you authorized the check in. Please in the future be vigilant on the communications of rules about travelling. I had no money and if you didn’t autorised the check in i was in the obligation of sleeping in the airport with two small kids. Just because of a missed information from you. Hope that there won’t be a problem on my return date Skopje-Basel/Mulhouse (30/07/2020)!",Negative

Btw the 'receipt' received of this strange action was also in Hungarian. So bye bye flight and bye bye money.",Negative
7379,"Wow ! I know with Covid going on everyone understands when flights and things change etc. The customer service I received today was utterly DISGUSTING! The man on the phone basically said the flight was changed from 6pm to 9am in the morning ( I can't make due to working in a school ). He was rude when I asked him ""Sorry was it my telephone number you asked for ? "" ( shouting back  ""phone number or email"") and then when he said I could only rebook or refund he told me to ""hurry up"" and make a decision!!!

All of this cost me at least 30 minutes. Then I tried to call Wizz Customer Service. That was not very helpful. Waited on the line for over 15 minutes. I explained the issue and I've been told that my card's fault (both!!??) or otherwise ""double currency setting"" on my bank account must be wrong (again, both?!). After another 15 minutes on the phone, Wizz recommended checking with my banks, obviously both. So, after an hour of time spent, it was on me to check something. Meanwhile, the flight price increased by around 10%. Then, I went to a competitor website, and I booked and paid for a flight in literally 2 minutes in total.

The customer service is terrible. No support or compensation is offered. When I've been stranded in Zurich in the evening without a flight I've been told they can`t cover hotel costs for flights scheduled the next day. Each staff member says something different and is generally very rude and unapologetic. They are clueless when it comes to re-booking, they've put me onto another airline service which didn't have anymore capacity. All my compensation claims have been rejected, including one where they said the flight to London was cancelled due to thunderstorms, when the weather was in fact cool and rain free. It's completely unreliable as an airline and the customer service is beyond terrible. I highly recommend using another airline, or at least avoiding peak flight times like mornings and evenings if you have no choice but to use them (although I met someone who had 3 swiss air flights from Zurich to London cancelled in one day so you're always taking a chance with them ).",Negative

Refused to re-route me after the customer service agent lost my seat on a rebooked flight because she was “confused”. Eventually I found a customer service agent who took five minutes to reroute me. Not a particular convenient reroute but at least I got there - albeit a few hours late. Problem with SWISS is that the flights are nothing special which is ok in itself but the moment something goes wrong such as a cancelled flight, you are shunted to an offshore customer service centre and then it gets really BAD. Having flown on SWISS countless times, the level of quality has declined to such an extent that I am doing something I never imagined I would in suggesting that this airline is simply not worth flying if you don’t have to.",Negative
7414,"A tragic story of once good and proud Swiss company. Due to misinformation from their person in Fiji (!!) I had to phone their supervisors in Switzerland. It was impossible to find ANY number that was responded in Europe. I spole 5 times with Fiji, 4 times with the similar call center in South Africa , and finally one time with a man in Australia, who disguised himself as phoning from a +41 number, but was actually in Australasia .somewhere. They had made a mistake in the Fiji office, and I spent a long time writing to them, and they would listen to the tape recording which would prove that I was in the right. However this man ended up phoning us after two days telling us that we could go and find another ticket. They would not honour the ticket that we had already paid for with my credit card. I have to agree with the other persons here who have put in one star. It’s really said that what are used to be one of the worlds best airlines, it’s now run like a salesman with used carpets in a bazar. Next time you talk to someone from Swiss, try and ask them where they are actually sitting? They don’t have their own offices anymore, but are hiring in agents around the world. So I have to agree with the others, Swiss it’s not worth using anymore. And I am concerned about the mother company Lufthansa as well, because the people in South Africa said that they are sitting right next to the ones wearing Lufthansa headset telephones. 😒",Negative

7429,"Shocking - My husband and I had an indirect flight from London Heathrow to Colombia for our honeymoon. We were checked in by staff and our luggages were taken, went through security and were eventually stopped right at the gate 5 minutes before departure.  The problem was what one of the staff called ""double dipping"". They told us as Iranian cirizens, we cannot transit through Europe twice but only once. None of the staff could explain why. This was missed by all other staff throughout the process. As a result we had to come back in and cross the border again to get into the UK and collect our luggages. The process took over 4 hours as we experienced long queues. At the gate we were asked to go to the Lufthansa desk and they would be able to put us on a different flight that would transit only once. When we went back to Heathrow departures and got our luggages, we went to Lufthansa office to speak to the duty manager. To our surprise, she not only didn't apologise for the incompetency of her staff when they checked us in and accepted our luggages, but had all the inappropriate behaviors I would have thought would be illegal by now.  This is the response we got from her with her hands in her pockets and rocking forward and backward with a smirk on her face: ""It is your fault that you couldn't board the plane as it is your responsibility to check your visa restrictions. We cannot help you. What difference would it have made if we hadn't checked you in. I know it wasted 4 hours but you couldn't have boarded anyway"". When we explained that Lufthansa shouldn't have checked us in and we would have at least been able to cancel the ticket or not go through the border and back in again her response was; ""I know this is frustrating but honestly your nationality is the problem"" I am very disappointed by the behaviour of Lufthansa staff. Firstly, racist behaviour is not acceptable from a senior duty manager. Secondly, this cost us thousands of pounds and ruined the first day of our honeymoon.  We had arranged with friends to pick us up from the airport, lost our flight tickets in Colombia and had to pay for the hotel. The least thing would have been an explanation in a nice manner.  We subsequently couldn't get any refund on our return flight as the outgoing one was marked as no show. We didn't even get an apology from Swiss air let alone ANY sort of REFUND.",Negative

We did NOT get a cancellation email or any notification what so ever. As transavia does not have an office in Bcn airport, there is an office handling their complains and redirections (Swisspoint). Arriving at the office in need of a new airplane as we have already parked our car and paid the parking, paid 2 nights in hotel and paid return tickets for 3 people. Here the staff does not do a single thing to help besides sliding a slip of paper with the telephone number and an email to transavia customer service and throwing the responsibility on edreams.com through whom we bought the tickets. (They throw responsibility back on transavia) We asked them about how it was possible that we could have gone through the security and being able to scan the boarding pass, their answer was that the flight was already canceled the day before and they had no idea. We were quite choked. This had happened to 2 other families. Apparently the rest of the flight was notified. In the midst of the frustration we try to call transavia but they just ask us several times (3 times) to call them back to get more information on what they can/will do for us. The final answer was that they “invite us to fill out a complain form online”. I just wonder why they didn’t invite us to another flight?

This is insanity. This is absurd. It is 8pm and I do not have a printer. It is 8pm and I cannot go to a Kinkos. Also, it is 2020..How is a cell phone screen receipt / bar code not sufficient? Not that this is huge topic for me, but let's just point out that they are also wasting paper. To top if off; THEY DO NOT REFUND UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE.

Me and my friend booked tickets to India ... two separate reservations and paid separately and had separate confirmation numbers. When reviewing the confirmation they had my friends name and date of birth wrong. To make things worse they cancelled both the tickets thinking they will be able to re book. The price had changed and that when they called my friend to let her know that they cancelled the tickets. I called and spoke with Steve, Peter and one other rep and asked why was my Ticket cancelled without even asking me. Instead of honestly admitting their mistake they all started making different stories. To their defense they said we tried to reach you but you did not answer so we cancelled the ticket. Here I am working and planning my upcoming trip just to find out that my ticket was cancelled. Such unprofessional and poor work ethic. I had to ask them to send me the email that the ticket was canceled and they have processed the refund, so I have some documentation because at this point I can not trust or believe any word. The rep types an email stating that refund was done and emails to me. I asked him when you charge you send proper document so where is the proof to show that you actually have processed the refund. Again no honest answer but rambling on and on.  Not even once any of the reps owned up for their  mistake Or offered any sort of help to rectify it . The solution given to me was I can book another ticket if I am willing to change my travel dates and willing to pay $300 more.",Postive

With everyone's anxiety levels to the roof at the moment, I can agree, it may feel like the company is abandoning you but my advice is to trust that they will call you and they will do everything they can to sort out your issues.  Please remember that they are a small company that doesn't usually get this many calls from customers ... The sudden influx had left the company scrambling to help every customer as fast as they can without the infrastructure needed to do so. Be patient and understanding. What's going on is not their fault, the airlines fault or yours.  everyone is doing the best they can and if they have to charge you a fee, it's in order to stay afloat and keep paying employees through all this.

Terrible Terrible terrible... I've been trying for 4 days to cancel my flights to Bali with no luck... Customer service line does not work... Just plays on a loop...

The airlines, Cathay Pacific, is refunding tickets purchased, confirmed with the airlines this morning, but when I email Skybooker, they say the airlines is not refunding.  I don't trust this site as far as I can throw them... I can totally understand that a travel agency could have their hands full at this time... I can also understand the customer service line not working (it being a small company and not having enough resources to handle the load) and I can also appreciate if they charge a fee for cancelling... They have to pay their bills after all... This situation is no one's fault... But what I can't accept it the misinformation and what appears to be avoiding customers.  They have responded to me twice and both times I received what felt like automated responses telling me that my airlines is not accepting cancellations and that I should basically get on my flight irrespective of what the restrictions are.  I have repeatedly asked for someone to call me back with no answer and it feels like they are rather giving me the run around until after my flight takes off.",Postive

The Airline is providing you the rebooking option wherein you can use your ticket before 31 Dec 2020 by paying fare and tax difference. Request you to decide and let us know the dates.

7930,"Very deceiving, you have to check in at the hotel, but can’t park there. You have to follow the van to a different parking location and hope that when you park there is room in the shuttle/small van to get you to the airport on time. Our reservation was for pick up at 5:00am, the van was late, and before we even had a chance to park, the van was full and were told we would have to wait until the van returned for another trip to the airport. At this point we didn’t have time as it was already 30 minutes beyond our reservation time. We left and found a better more accommodating shuttle company. We have tried numerous times to get in touch for a refund but have been unsuccessful.",Postive

Then they kept sending emails asking to choose an attractive option of generous credit point.  Then, there is no further actions from their side and there is no way to communicate with them. If they are facing techincal difficulties as they claim, how on earth they keep uploading attractive Ads on their website? I wonder if anyone got their money back from them.

People have alot to say specially Negative Feedbacks. I do understand what your are all going through. But looking at the current scenario and circumstances of COVID 19. I think the company is doing a Great Job. There are alot of things to process and alot of approvals from different departments that the company goes through to refund our transactions. I was completely refunded rather I had opted for a voucher which I did receive and I am pretty happy with the service. Give them sometime. I would rather give them a little more extra time. But at the end your refund or your issue will surely be resolved. I am just sharing my personal experience. Hope you all get your refunds soon.

The flight went without us, along with our 3,900 GBP.  No reply to emails, no updates or communication.

7978,Very disappointing experience so far. A few months ago I booked with bravofly a flight in July from Spain to Tanzania operated by Emirates / Fly Dubai / Precision Air. Due to covid I wanted to cancel and Emirates allowed refunds for that period. Bravofly even send me an email that schedule is changing and I would need to decide if I agree or want to cancel. Even better I thought! So far nothing happened. The app stated that my request is in progress...until a few weeks later status jumped back to booking confirmed!!! That happened twice so far. I never received a cancellation quote or any feedback so far. When logging into my booking on Emirates.com 4 of my 5 flight segments have disappeared. Even if wanted I couldnt travel now anymore as the flights disappeared. No information from bravofly. The flight is in 10 days and I cannot reach anyone! The app allows you to request a cancellation but thats it. No possibility to comment on the situation.,Negative

7982,"After using Fly Scanner as norm the top result came up with Kiwi.com. There were two flights I liked the look of one leaving at 12 the other at 12:20. I realised within a minute of booking the latter that once you arrive at Heathrow you then had to travel to Standsted to get the connecting flight.. a box appeared giving me the option to cancel.  I received an automated mail saying It  had not worked..I had to google their number as the price I paid did not include contact details right away .. I got through to this agent who had no empathy and was soo rude and stated I could rebook the other flight but I would have to pay £314 again minus £10.. I bit the bullet and organised a National Express. Due to corona virus my flights got cancelled. Kiwi offer you these options. 1 To chase the refund yourself 2 get a voucher 3 let them do the chasing with a fee and receive the money quicker.. 4 let them do the chasing which will take longer. I chose the first option , when I called BA it was then I learned that Kiwi.com had not booked it under my name or credit card and so they refused to refund me. I called Kiwi and told them, they said they could not help me as I had chosen to take full responsibilty of chasing the refund, I said how it was not possible. After arguing for some time I  was told to pose as my mother and say that i lived in Czech Republic and used a mastercard that was not mine.. In a nutshell I have finally gotten the money back from the airlines but Kiwi are keeping hold of £70 of it despite saying on their refund policy that if a flight is cancelled they will refund in full.. BEST ADVICE make sure you choose the option to chase the refund yourself,  reading other  reviews can see that people are still waiting for their money after opting for Kiwi to chase refund...and sometimes the fee they pay kiwi out weight the flight cost. Make sure you get the Mastercard details that Kiwi have used so you can get your money back. Don't pay for any upgrades  vip etc you can get their number by searching in Google. Also make sure when you are chasing your refund from airline CHANGE itinerary  to YOUR email address or ask airline to send you a copy of confirmation so you know how much the airline has paid back. Overall worst customer service , I had to hang up on a couple of agents to try get hold of somone who was not aggressive.. will never deal with a again.",Negative

I waited and re-tried several times over the course of the night without sleeping! So now my wife had no booked flight and apparently I needed to go all the way to Heathrow (instead of Gatwick which was the departure airport for my wife's flight) to complete payment but for some reason I had to do that by a certain time otherwise I would have to pay a no-show fee for the flight they already cancelled!? Meanwhile another guy tells me I don't even need to go because the flight is already booked while another guy tells me to call back on a number that doesn't even work (despite me telling him that when he gave it to me)!

Changed at Istanbul and whilst sat in my seat watched our 2 year olds car seat in bright orange travel bag fall off an open baggage cart and bounce several times on the runway. Unceremoniously chucked back in, but then after being loaded, the container came back out and a case that was not going was tanked out, which made our seat fall about 8 feet to the floor again. Went to report it on landing but no one was in the office, but I was told we had 7 days to report it. Provided all details online, including the baggage truck 525 who had caused the damage and photos of them at the hold with it, only to be told sorry no PIR so tough! Then on collection of cases at Manchester, my big expensive Samsonite case had the handle smashed to bits. This time I went to baggage, got a print out from them and submitted it thinking that would be fine. Nope, how wrong I was. Case rejected for no PIR again. I questioned why this was, to be given this reply: Your claim has been evaluated.As per company standard you were required to have a report written before leaving the terminal as soon as it occured. Particulary exterior damages to the luggage has to be reported within the day of occuring. Due to the fact above,it is out of question for the claim to be reconsidered. I'm now liaising with a solicitor about taking this to small claims court. Fortunately I located a replacement handle and fitted it myself, but my car seat has unknown impact damage to the shell from the falls it had so for safety I cant use it with a clear conscience. A shame that back office penpushers behave like this and sour my experience as the cabin crew (the real workers and face of the company) were so so good at service and looking after our little one. Sadly I wont be rushing to use them anytime soon.

Contacted exploretrip to reschedule assuming all I would have to pay was the difference between the new ticket amount on their website ($1563 per ticket) and the amount I had already paid ($1285 per ticket), which comes down to around $278 per ticket. I was told that I would have to pay an additional $470 per ticket, when asked for the breakdown how they arrived at that amount, they would refuse to explain. I had the same ticket booked with a different agency (Flight Network), where I only had to pay the difference between $1568 and the amount I had paid for my initial booking. Not sure why Exploretrip is not doing the same....",Negative
8046,"My nightmare with ExploreTrip started when I tried to look up my flights online on the airline website with the booking number they have provided in the email receipt to me, it said ""We couldn’t find your reservation with the provided data. Please, verify the information and try again."" Unfortunately, due to COVID 19, I could not make a flight. I had to find out by myself that my flight was canceled, no email or notification from ExploreTrip has been sent to me! After multiply emails to their customer service, they responded to me: ""if you ticket is cancelled by the airline you will receive a full refund (only for unused flights) to the same account. If your departure is within 72 hours, we request you to contact the airline directly or our Customer Support immediately."" As my flight was within 72 hours, I called them up, was waiting for an hour, and later was on hold almost for an hour with the customer representative who called himself Addison. First, he said that my booking code (they call it PNR#) wasn't working because I have to contact them to get an airline booking code, the nonsense I have never heard before, even though I've been to almost 50 countries and used many companies for the booking my flights. He provided me the ""new code from the airline"". Later on I checked my reservation and it was another one PNR# which was already indicated in my booking receipt! Of course, it also did not work and Addison said it is because my flight has been canceled by the airline. I asked him for a full refund but he assured me that the only way to receive at least something is to confirm the cancelation of my reservation and I will receive a credit which I can use only with the airline my initial booking was made and I can use it by 25/AUG/2021. However, I learned out that by the U.S. Department of Transportation, ENFORCEMENT NOTICE REGARDING REFUNDS BY CARRIERS GIVEN THE UNPRECEDENTED IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY ON AIR TRAVEL: ""Carriers have a longstanding obligation to provide a prompt refund to a ticketed passenger when the carrier cancels the passenger’s flight or makes a significant change in the flight schedule and the passenger chooses not to accept the alternative offered by the carrier."" I emailed them that I would like to receive a full refund instead of the credit, they sent me an email that they have escalated my case the different department and I have never heard from them since then. As to call them is wasting your time, they will trick you, lie to you, put on hold or hang up on you, I decided to complain to all services which I can and also to share my horrible experience with this company.",Negative

I even made a connected phone call with the airline and ExploreTrip so the airline could tell the agent directly about their refund policy. THE AGENT STILL DENY MY REFUND. Even if I want to get a voucher instead of a refund, ExploreTrip still asks me to pay a few hundred dollars for the service fee in order to issue me a voucher which makes completely no sense to me.

The attendant said we'd have to drive up to the top to find the self parking spaces, and if there were no spaces, come back down, and we could valet park with no extra charge.

In addition I incurred cost on personal items that I had to purchase in the meantime. In addition I would like to add discomfort walking three days in the same pair of jeans and flip flops, phone cost for calls outside the EU and half day wasted chasing the luggage with various people (airport journey included).

The crew Bernand LeComte and Mergim Alidimas were absolutely fantastic with the passengers and handed out water and other needs that were in demand. They returned with regular information and kept the mood on top, which was infected by us travelers who were slightly stressed and nervous. Thanks for a very tumultuous but yet pleasant journey.

It took us several hours to rebook a flight for the day after through several phone calls, as several staff members just claimed everything was full or they couldn't do anything. The repayment of some drinks we had at the airport was ridiculous, we all had to deliver a signed document to allow them to pay the money to one person of our group...

There is also a timer on the screen showing how much we have left till landing. I loved that, as we could see how much more it was going to take.

When I sent a message to the customer services about this, I was politely told that it was not their fault as the flight was ""affected by irregularity"". When we were waiting for the flight to leave brussels we were told this irregularity was due to the airline not accounting for the flying hours of the crew - they had to get a fresh crew to come in as they had messed up their organisation. All in all, the entire trip cost more than double what we were expecting and the ""its your problem"" attitude of this airline is the reason I will never be flying with them again and would strongly advise anyone else not to either.

8135,"They actually helped me get a refund, after I had trouble with scanning my digital ticket at the Munich airport where the flight was navigated by Lufthansa (whose personell at G28 information treated me like a customer shall never be treated, totally unresponsible and unhelpful - a real nightmare). The Brussel Airlines was never a problem really, apart from my ticket not working in the scanner at the Munich airport for some reason, and I took the fight with Lufthansa first and with no help from them, I now called Brussel Airlines whose information was lovely and helpful. A 10 minute conversation and explanation, and now I have a refund for the ticket of my missed flight, I didn't even need to fill out a form, I had the option to do so though to avoid a cancellation fee but I just wanted this over with. Thank you Brussel Airlines! Your flights were good, and I will remember you being the ones who helped me when Lufthansa in Munich treated me like I was nothing worth.",Postive
8136,"Must say I’m very disappointed with Brussels Airlines and I haven’t even flown with you yet. In January my husband paid for seats in Economy Privileged and we were looking forward to the extra things that we thought we would be offered. But NO Brussels Airlines no longer offers Economy Privileged seats, they are now called Comfort Zone seats. We will still be seated in the seats we paid for, BUT we will not be offered a welcome beverage, travel kit, thicker blanket, Neuhaus chocolate or noise reducing headphones, just the extra legroom. I was given this trip to New York by my husband and we were looking forward to a holiday without kids therefore we paid a little bit extra. We only found out ourselves, Brussels Airlines didn’t even had the effort to inform us about the changes.",Negative
8137,"Terrible service. Delayed all the time, sells tickets with the minimum legal airport connection time, their airplanes seem to fall apart since every delay is due to some ""technical problems"" and if you want Infos in what to do because they botched up again and you need to get your connecting flight, the only answer is ""run?"". For a national airline this is an utter disgrace. Seriously, I'd rather drive a car that I need to pedal manually while being in fire before I fly with this airline ever again.",Negative
8138,"Flight from Billund 0645 to Brussels - delayed to 0925 today March 21. They apparently knew about this delay the day before, but did not inform their passagers.

Book with another airline than Brussels Airlines - if you can.",Negative
8139,That was worst service and worst airport i have ever seen. I recommend everyone do not choose that company.,Negative
8140,Well am I surprised that there are so many negative experiences here? Not in the slightest. If you flight happens to go well and all you bags make it in one piece you’ll be happy you paid their low fare. If you have reason at all to contact the airline be prepared for officialdom. Be prepared for rules and regulations and misinformation repeated and reinforced. Be prepared to have the same patronising phrases repeated in emails. Be prepared for little help. They will do all they can to avoid even the basic rights of customers who approach them and they will not see an opportunity to improve their services. Only way I would use them is if they are far cheaper than any of the other airlines on the same route.,Negative
8141,"Shockingly poor customer service, possibly illegal.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Forced to put our hand luggage into the hold.  They then lost ALL of it due to their ineffective tags which can't be scanned properly at Barcelona airport.  Wasted hours at the airport in the queues for lost baggage.  Eventually located half a day later and sent on to our hotel but during this time we'd needed to buy a change of clothes (so that not all of our plans for that day would be ruined).  Their policy states this is permitted.  On returning and lodging a claim they stated it was denied since our bags had been returned within 24 hours.  I've repeatedly asked them to show me where this timeframe is stated in their terms - I've looked and certainly can't find any mention.  They've repeatedly ignored this query which one can only assume means they are unable to prove it.  If you do any kind of search you'll find their customer service is appalling and they frequently lose your luggage then deny any valid claims.  Will never fly with them again",Negative
8142,"Flight itself is just ok. Not the best but so so. However my complain is about the offer they sent via the app, two days after the deadline of booking. Offer is about 50% discount to many destinations. Well it seems the offer is designed just for showing where they fly to and keep you reading through it. Pegasus! Please dont do such black hat marketing. People are not daft, they will catch you.",Negative
8143,"VERY VERY BAD. Staff in Manchester was extremely rude. Especially the old woman that handle the counter. The flight was overbooked. No seat for us. They didn’t apologise, they pressured us to make decision within 5 minutes. Should be dismissed. Their shift was Wednesday morning, 26th February 2020). Flight cancelled for Madrid to Barcelona trip. I want to rant further but other review seems already mentioned it. Very bad.",Negative
8144,"The Worst Flight Ever!!! If I could give 'minus' Stars, I would! Buyer Beware as I booked a return flight to Barcelona with BRITISH AIRWAYS to avoid any 'Mickey Mouse' airlines and so paid extra.  Unbeknown to me, my booking was passed to a 'partner' and onto VILE VUELING :( Not only am I a Seasoned International Traveller but I am a Businesswoman and have reached that 'certain age' plus I rarely find cause to make a fuss onboard but what ensued on the return journey was nothing short of outrageous! We were delayed due to a panel having 'fallen off' the plane which they were unable to reattach in a hurry!  We all had to disembark and wait for another plane and nearly 5 hours later we finally left. Passengers were getting tired and hungry and a steward (Maximillian) confirmed we would received complimentary refreshments but the reality was very different.  After ordering a coffee and a small packet of biscuits I was expected to pay E4.5 which I understandably questioned.  I was told by the charmless  stewardess 'Blanca' who immediately threatened, if I didn't pay I would be 'reported to the Captain'!  Rather unreasonable as AVIATION LAW says otherwise plus each Passenger I was now entitled to £250 Compensation ... I'll come to that later. I voiced my disappointment and as I was in the window seat, my solution was to pass my coffee & biscuits along the line and it was given back to 'Blanca' by the aisle passenger with not a drop spilt.  'Blanca' however, had other ideas and flounced off only to return to enlighten me the Airport Police were now going to meet me at LGW! Other passengers witnessed this ridiculous 'Little Britain' situation and gave their support but when we landed, sure enough the Police boarded and asked me to escort them off the plane!  In hindsight I should have questioned this crazy escalation on the spot and in front of the passengers but I dutifully left the plane not wishing to hold up the disembarkation. However, what I was accused of left me stunned and almost speechless as 'Blanca' had accused me off 'throwing the coffee all over her'!!!  Clearly she had told a terrible lie and clearly she was some sort of 'psycho stewardess' out to create havoc over E4.50!  Naturally, she was proved wrong and the Police were non too happy about their time and resources being wasted in such a spiteful way. I wrote to British Airways who immediately 'passed the buck' straight back to Vueling which really upset me.  So, I wrote to Vueling, emailed them, phoned them countless times, got promised Compensation but and naturally got absolutely nothing let alone receiving an explanation or an Official Apology :( The Reviews left with regard to this awful Airline speak for themselves and I have no idea how they remain in business let alone why British Airways has anything to do with such a disreputable company. At the very least British Airways they should have taken responsibility and resolve this unnecessary and exceptionally unpleasant matter.",Negative

8146,"I was subjected to a most embarrassing and degrading experience. Having booked and paid for an extra space seat (2c), when I arrived at the check-in the desk clerk offered me a seat on an emergency exit isle as it had ‘more room’. All with the best of intentions I am sure. When seated, I asked a crew member for a seat belt extender, and she barked at me that I could not have one sitting there and ordered me to move to another seat. The seat I was forced to move to was not an extra legroom seat and proved completely in appropriate for someone my size. I protested that I had paid an upgrade fee, but was told to go to the desk in Barcelona. When the attendant handed me the seatbelt extenders she could not have made it more overt, so all the surrounding passengers could see, it was as though she was handing a lasso an elephant. This experience was humiliating, demeaning and discriminatory in the extreme, and the fear of being removed from the plane prevented me from protesting further. If I could have found another flight to Barcelona I would have walked off the plane. This company is not interested at all in the fact that 1) I did not get what I paid for, and 2) their customers are discriminated against and humiliated without any redress. I also ordered a hot chicken meal - big mistake, it was not reheated sufficiently well at all! AVOID, especially if you are of large build, or disabled in any way.",Negative
8147,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS Traveled from Manchester to Barcelona in September 2018.The flight was delayed by over 5 hours, have contacted Vueling probably around 50 times. They hang up on you, ignore your emails when you finally get a response it's just a automated email. I have made a claim against them with Delayed Again and am hopefully getting my money back a year and a half after my trip. I would never ever use this airline, their customer service is nonexistent. If you have had a delayed flight please contact a legal representative it will take a chunk of the compensation but trust me it will save you having to repeatedly try to contact them.",Negative
8148,"Attempted to placate drunk angry man during flight by giving him MORE FREE BEER. This resulted in the guy physically assaulting- punching repeatedly- another passenger and staff did absolutely nothing, despite people shouting help and for the police to be called - nothing at all.

8149,"My girlfriend and I received a message on 28 June 2018 at 06:25 to inform us the flight would not be operated. I made contact with Vueling's client services and I was told I could fly home from Florence the next day (booking Q94NKF). Unfortunately that flight was cancelled again and we had the choice to fly back with Vueling on 1 July or find an other solution ourselves; since I was expected back at work on Friday and Vueling could not guarantee we would fly back on Sunday, I bought a ticket at Alitalia. No compensation given for 2 cancelled flights. In my experience the worst company I ever dealt with. If you want to enjoy your holidays, make sure you choose a reliable airline ....... NOT Vueling.",Negative
8150,"I made a mistake when booking the flight (my fault) and I made it for a wrong month. I called them to check if I could cancel it or change it to another date. I was not allowed to cancel it. So the only option was to change it to another date. If you do the change less than 24 hours after buying the ticket, no fee is applied. I asked the date to be changed for next year. Unfortunately they don't have 1 year open in the system. So I asked to either get a refund or a voucher, so I could get the flights for next year without paying the additional fee. The answer was they don't do it. At the end I will have to pay a fee in the future to change the flights to Feb 2021, which is not fair",Negative

My flight was made by my secretary and as a policy I don't fly Ryanair or Wizz Air because the staff are like delinquent children, TAB are a bit dirty, like being in a barn and as for Iberia I think they have more planes than staff, definitely no phones being forwarded to anyone with common sense. ----'Flight Reclaim are pleased to advise that the airline have now accepted full liability for the disruption you experienced, though at this time have not provided a timescale for when we should expect to receive your compensation payment.

Both flights had a delay and than finally in Bishkek our luggage did not arrive. No Mail No Info from the Airline nothing! Today over one day later we received one packbag. The other is still missing. That is what we know from Bishkek Airport. Again No Info from Pegasus. This airline made our trip or at least the start to a nightmare.

The aircraft is dirty (trays are still sticky from previous passengers) which means it wasn't cleaned after the flight. We would hear very loud noises each time the Captain moves, tilts, or raise the wings. (Which made everyone panic by the way). After I received the bottle of water which costed me like 10 Turkish Liras, I found it to be a super tiny bottle comparing to the price. I asked for a bigger bottle (1 Litres), the hostess said they only have one size (knowing that two minutes earlier I saw her holding two 1 Litres bottles. The Onboard Wifi (the flight info system) doesn't work (your device will keep obtaining IP address and at the end it say Obtaining IP failed). The audio system which is embedded on the side of the seats was off. It's just there for nothing. The air conditioning was on but blowing really almost hot air. All passengers were sweating and complaining. The attitude of the employees was just very rude. On the floor, I could see some broken covers coving from somewhere.... Like come on pegasus, where is the maintenance? Why does your aircraft release cracking sounds ? You can never hear the Captain's announcements, the volume is super low, and you can't understand what is he saying. ....... Before landing, one host came to hand comment cards to passengers, he won't hand you a card if you don't ask for it, and he doesn't ask you if you needed one, he simply passes by, and it's your job to notice what's in his hand.

It transpired that the gentleman on the desk was new to the job and was looking at the time of our connecting flight in Izmir. He asked someone else to check this who then took our confirmation away and eventually returned some 20 minutes later. He then apologised and said that everything was ok and then we were told the gates were closed and because we had 2 suitcases we couldn’t board. He told us to go to the Pegasus desk opposite to see what they could do. The representative there told us that they couldn’t let us on the flight as we had 2 suitcases and putting them on the plane would unbalance it. Our only option was to buy 2 new tickets for the next available flight which was the next day at 5 p.m. I put a complaint in to Pegasus only to be told that we had gone to the wrong check in. What a load of nonsense. They made reference to their report. When I asked for a copy of their report I was told the only way I could obtain this was through a Court of Law. I even contacted an Independent Board Member, of Pegasus Airlines, who tried to help but couldn't. Pegasus has lost a lot of money from our Family alone.

Unfortunately, I had 2 trips from hell with this airline and as a result I will never use them again. This was a connect flight from Russia to London. I booked it a long while back before I'd known I was pregnant, so the matters were made worse by the fact that I'm now 5 months pregnant. To get to Moscow we flew using S7 airline from Irkutsk.... Two airlines are like night and day. S7 was a comfortable, clean plane with professional, organised and friendly staff. The same can not be said about Pegasus. On our first flight from Moscow to Istanbul (5h10min) we sat in a dirty plane (fingerprints and snort on windows, dirty toilets, sellotaped table and a constant flicking light bulb above my seat) in a boiling temperature. It was so hot I couldn't stop fanning myself for one minute and when I asked to buy water I was told that only dollars or euros were accepted, which I didn't have (roubles or pounds only). They wouldn't accept my debit card either, as they only take credit cards. By the time we got to Istanbul I was so thirsty I though I would faint.  How is this allowed? While we were waiting for our second flight in the airport in Turkey we bought some chocolates and souvenirs. As it was a lot colder than in Russia (we were originally travelling from Siberia), we put our coats into our hang luggage so that we don't carry them around, the souvenirs were put there also. During boarding we were told that our hand luggage was 2kg over for which they wanted us to pay, so we ended up putting our coats back on and shoving chocolates into our pockets.... This may be a minor mishap but it added to the whole unpleasant experience dealing with the airline. On the flight to London (4h) there were water issues again. This time not with me , but with the person sitting next to us who needed to take some medication. When he asked a member of staff for a bit of water, he was told that he had to buy a bottle. The man didn't have any dollars and they wouldn't accept a debit card so he had to pay with 50 Euro note to which they didn 't have change. The man ended up buying a lot of food that he didn't eat to just get that water. He was also shocked by the fact that you can't get water on this airline free of charge.

Turns out that it's a mini 2nd check in line to confirm that you have the necessary documents and reason to travel to Cuba (???) while waiting in line for the mini check in, i saw 3 persons get refused their travel from the US to Cuba.... Wouldn't the reverse logistic work best for all!? I mean can Jetblue check travel to Cuba entitlemnt PRIOR to check in?! I have written to the airline to share my customer experience... NEVER HEARD BACK FROM THEM. EVER!!! I mean really?! Anyways an over all travel booking and checking in WAY BELOW EXPECTATION CHEAPEST TICKET ON THE MARKET THAT DAY OR NOT.... Too bad because the in-air service and comfort of crafts are great. The logistic and customer service on land needs to be revised and corrected URGENTLY!",Negative

8182,Brought daughter home from college with 2 large bags.  I called in advance and asked how best to do this economically and efficiently.  So I paid in advance for large bags.  When we got to check in they said fee was first 100.00 for heavy bag and then an additional 100.00 for over dimension.  Not happy about this and asked for policy where this is written both over weight and size.  None was available.  I then asked them to credit what i bought in advance.  They said they could not do this.  So i eventually ended up paying 300.00 to ship 95 pound bag.  Could have bought bag  a seat for less from Orlando.  Felt like I was ripped off.

After scrambling around the airport, we found an American Airlines flight to Rhode Island (at least close enough) that night. We contacted both Jet Blue and Cheap Tickets the next day because the ""partners"" had failed us, and we just wanted a credit for the value of the trip home (about $380 for two). They said they couldn't credit us $380 but Jet Blue would reimburse the ""value"" of the cancelled flight. Jet Blue offered a ridiculous total of $120.18 for TWO passengers to get from Ft.

Realizing this and being in the 6th row, I asked the FWD flight attendant If I could be let off first. I told her I only had  carry on luggage. She rudely told me,"" I don't have any empty seats up front to move you to"".  I didn't ask to be moved, all I wanted was to be let off first, before the 30 passengers in the first five rows. Extremely unacommadating . We landed at 0120P and without deboarding first, I missed my connection. I saw my connecting flight being pushed back by the Tug. I immediately went to the JetBlue Just ASK desk and handed Hispanic Nancy my ticket. The first words out of her mouth, "" why you late"". I said it's your fault, JetBlue. She started mumbling words, so I asked if I could speak to her supervisor. After several minutes her supervisor shows up and I try to tell her that it was JetBlue's fault for my missing my connecting flight. She goes into defense mode and is raising her voice stating that it was the Air Traffic Controller's fault and she has no control over the Air Traffic Controller and storms off. I called JetBlue using my App. and talked to a representative who assisted me in filling a formal complaint. We included the names of the desk person as well as the name of her supervisor, who I had the encounter with. I was told, "" someone from JetBlue will be contacting you within the next two days"".

8271,"was travelling CPH-BKK with 3 kids - one of them our 7 months baby (small for her age - 7 kg/70 cm). Got seats in front of the wall behind the toilets, as expected to be able to get a crib for the youngest. When entering the aircraft, we asked for the crib (when airborne of course) and the staff denied us the crib because the baby was over 6 months? I've flown with several airlines and have been given a crib for my almost 1 year old.. and I asked politely if the age was important over the weight considering a 6 month baby easily could be much heavier and longer than our baby, and I off course would take full responsibility using the crib. The staff got angry and started threatning us - telling us we could leave the aircraft and made a scene with several staff incl a groundservice person ... they were SO rude and we have never experienced anything like that... If it was'nt for the case that we have a return flight bought already on dec 17, I'll say we rather take a stop with another airline than flying Thai again...  worst thing was they tried to use the safety-issue as an excuse for not giving us a crib - but when I asked for the seatbelt for the  baby they did not have any and tried to convince me it was MUCH safer to use my arms... SUCH a joke. and illegal I guess?. Thai - you have to step up your service!",Negative
8272,"We've been trying to get our money back since May'17 for a cancelled flight to Vietnam - a Zika prevalent country after falling pregnant 2 months after the booking. The WHO issued a warning to pregnant women not to travel to Vietnam at the time, hence the need to cancel! Although we booked through a third party, Thai Airways refused to pass on the refund and instead fined us nearly £200 each. We followed the procedure to only speak to the 3rd party but Thai Airways have seized the communications with them and would not detail the reasons why the full refund should not be issued. Numerous complaints later, we are still no closer to the answer why they would not issue a full refund! Disgraceful! I will be taking them to small claims court and launch an official complaint with CAA just finding the time to do it proves tricky! I will get to the bottom of this!",Negative
8273,I flew from Bangkok to Stockholm and I think it's almost the only airline besides SAS that flies directly. Its very convenient not having to transfer and wait in some transit anywhere.

I was travelling with 8 my 5 & years old kids From Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok with onwards flights from Bangkok to Paris. My children and I are French national of African descent. To our utter shock and honor we were denied boarding and left stranded in an foreign airport because all 6 staff members at the boarding gate check in counter could not believe that black people could possibly be French. We lost in excess of USD 4,000 and when trying to reach Thai Airways to refund our tickets money we were told we would need to claim from the travel agent. How unbelievably stupid can staff in an airline that deal with international travel be. They mercilessly mocked my children for claiming to be French nationals and literally confiscated our passports with the intent to destroy them!!! How can such a thing happen.

8275,"Flew MUC-BKK-HKT in May 2017 in business class. Pros: Flights on time at departure and arrival as well as connections. Service impeccable, friendly, fast, efficient, from start until after landing. Hot towels, beverages in ample supply (only brand names!), food many choices and exceptional tasty and a coffee (from Thailand mountains, as I understood) so excellent, I have never ever experienced before. Tip: Drink it without milk and sugar, just coffee, it is unbelievable fantastic! Not bitter, with a fruity taste, I am still looking to get in touch with the plantation to import it into Europe. Any help greatly appreciated!! Amenities with everything you might need on a flight: Dental kit, shaver kit, comb, shades, shoes and a complete kit, too (see photo). Flat-beds with mattress, covers and pillows, large bathrooms, and, as mentioned before, a cabin crew, that really cares for their paxs. Inflight entertainment system perfectly working with hundreds of movies and music to select. Earphones clean!! and with good sound. Cons: From MUC to BKK was B747, very old A/C, some seat covers torn, need maintenance urgently, but at least clean and everything was working. BKK to HKT newer, much better maintained A/C. Travel Tip: Upper deck, of course, and window. Try the coffee!",Postive

8279,"THE MOST HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE I EVER HAD. The service is extremely bad. I frequently travel and this is the first time that I have to call a company 3 times and still the problem does not get solved. I needed to add a priority to a ryanair flight booked through them. I phoned 3 times during the same day in order to get the e-mail with the instructions for the payment. The e-mail eventually arrived 8 hours after my first phone call. I would like to mention that your service does not come for free + I had to pay 3 times for phone calls to England. Furthermore you do not warranty any better service to the client but actually the price to add the priority through you is even higher than doing it with ryanair. So where is the advantage of using flyhacks? Please tell me because I don´t see it really. Customer service is polite and I understand it is not their fault but provide them with more options and more info if the system is not working properly. I wish I could have looked at trustpilot before making the booking. Furthermore, when a company is not serious you see it from the fact that they ignore bad reviews and just reply to the few good ones and they don´t improve the service at all. Horrible horrible horrible.",Negative

Not sure how my payment could not pass security when they’re able to take the money in the first place. They said they would refund me but gave no timeframe and would not confirm the account to which it will be refunded. On being pressed they told me it would take 3-5 working days. On expiry of 5 working days, they told me it would be 7-10 working days. It’s now been over 10 working days and I still have not received my refund. AVOID.",Negative
8282,"Do NOT use Flyhacks. Almost any company would be better. You can rest assured I will never be booking with them again, neither should you and here is why: I booked a flight from Italy to France back in Nov/2018 to fly later this month (April 2019). Flyhacks did not send me any sort of confirmation email, but luckily I had taken a screenshot as I purchased it, so when I pressed them over email to send me my information, they were able to find it. Here I am today, 5 days before I leave the US. I went to do early check-ins for all my flights so I could have the tickets handy and I find out one of my flights was canceled. No one even contacted me to tell me. I repeat, NO ONE BOTHERED TO LET ME KNOW that I would be stranded on my layover with no options. Alone. In a place that’s actually not that safe for a young woman to travel. I contacted customer support immediately and they said sorry they didn’t contact me but they could get me on a flight the next day and just to wait where I had my layover for 24 hours. UNACCEPTABLE. I need to be in France on the day that my flight is booked for. How can Flyhacks think this is an acceptable solution? I wrote them back asking for a better solution or a full refund and they have not responded in several hours. Clearly customer satisfaction is not a priority for this company. I am extremely disappointed in they way they handled this situation, and especially in the lack of communication once my flight was canceled. I could have had lots of time to figure this out. Instead I am trying to see if I can even book another flight. When I do, I won’t be using Flyhacks. Shame on you guys. In conclusion to anyone who reads this review: don’t use Flyhacks. Don’t expect customer service to be helpful. Make sure you take a screenshot of everything you do so you can prove you even bought tickets through them.",Negative

After I read the bad reviews, I've called them first to make sure that they will send my tickets and to do my check-in, but the UK phone no on their site didn't worked, so I had to call in a different country. The other small issue was that the dimensions of the cabin baggage from Southampton were a bit less than the usual dimensions, so I was charged with another £40. If you call them and ask for all the details necessary for your flight, everything should run smoothly ( pay attention to your cabin baggage dimensions for each airline) Cheers",Postive

Kommt man der Aufforderung nicht rechtzeitig nach, ist man absolut nicht eingecheckt. Dabei muss gesagt werden, dass die Personendetails fast schon etwas vorgeschoben wirken; bei keinem mir bekannten Anbieter wurde je nach Id-nummer, Ausstellungsdatum und Gueltigkeit, gefragt. Eine Benachrichtigung vor dem Abflug darueber, dass der Kunde nicht eingecheckt ist, findet - abgesehen von dem Hinweis zum Eintreffen dieses Falles in dem Schreiben 4 Tage bevor, nicht statt und auch im Kundenbereich der Flyhacks-Internetseite fehlt jeglicher Hinweis hierzu, was den Eindruck erwecken koennte, dass dies Teil eines Business-Modells ist. Der Kundenservice scheint sich besonders auf die dringlichen Anfragen zu beschraenken. Es folgt mein unbeantwortetes Schreiben an die Gesellschaft: Dear Olga  I am alienated by your company. In the beginning I thought Flyhacks is just a cheap offerer who wants to appear youthfully and advantageously. That there were some sloppy translation mistakes into german,  didn't bother me too much.  In fact I would have very much preferred to ""hack"" in the mentioned below details already the first time, when I purchased my ticked. At least had I expected to have the possibility to still ""hack"" the missing details in the day before the flight. I was following the link 23 hours before the flight, but then it was too late I guess. I was even trying to check in myself on the internet site of the airlines in question, because I had the presentiment that there might be something wrong. But then it is first written in the mail, that you are checked in automatically and only afterwards follows - I have to admit - a clear invitation to complete the details. Why you need to know or ""hack"" details like the no. of the passport, expiration date, ... 4 days before seems to be somewhat inherent to the company's buissiness (""hacking"")model. I hardly can remember ever having had to give this informations befor with any other offerer.  When I first opened flyhack's information e-mail 4 days before the flight, I didn't look to close to it and I couldn't remember, which details might be missing. And then the days passed and I expected that everything would go its way like it usually does wiht other companies.  To make it short, I don't think this whole procedure is very pratical, and I will reserve my right to publish this opinion on occasion.",Negative

We didn't hear from you for three days, and tried to call you multiple times, but you have the worst answering rate i have ever tried at a 24/7 desk. Finally after three days you replied, but now the tickets were no longer available. Insted you proposed a new set of ticket - one day later however and extending the total travel time with 8 hours.

The night before the flight I couldn't check in with the app, but I figured this would be fine. The airline would help me out. Of course this low budget European airline didn't and I had to pay 55 euros just to check in at the gate. Terrible customer service on their end. When I reached out to Flyhacks for support I simply got a ""it's your fault nothing we can do"" typical bad customer service review. I was told I should have used their corporate email to check in myself, as if I would have any reason on earth to know that.

When I rang I was told to secure a seat I must first book (pay $350) and secure a economy class ticket then at the airport upgrade to business class. Which I did. but at the airport they didn't adjust the difference. Not only that I asked for two prices DAC to PER and SIN to PER (SIN was transit). As DAC to SIN was day time leg of the journey I wasn't fussed about business class. SIN to PER was night time - which I really wanted. The one price they gave me $940 USD was presented to me as the cost of upgrade to Business class, I assumed it was DAC to PER and I ask they got annoyed and said yes sir this is the cost of upgrade to business. They didn't tell me it was only DAC to SIN. On arrival to SIN I realized I got duped, what they had done is only given me business class up to SIN. Not just that SIN to PER my entertainment unit on the seat was broken - I can provided pic. they didnt reset or fixed for upto 2:30hrs in the 5-6hr flight. No water was provided to me for 3hrs as the seat belt sign was on even though there was hardly any turbulence. The food that they served was terrible, all cold and dry. They didnt serve any hot drinks even though it was freezing. I choose a window seat and paid extra on top (can provided receipt) to choose a seat with window but my seat had no window. When I complained it felt on deaf ears. And it goes in circle, they will apologies which means nothing to them. But wont compensate or pay back the money they overcharged or in access of what they should have charged. On top of my original economy ticket which was about 1k, I unfortunately paid almost another 2k just for terrible terrible poor service. Pic attached of the broken inflight entertainment system.

Our flight got delayed when we were already in the plane, so from 4:30a to 5:45a it moved and went back to the gate, supposedly because of fog but they had no copilot and thats why they had to go back. That took over one hour, once we arrived to Fort Lauderdale at 7am at we couldnt get off the plane for another hour and 45 minutes which made us lose our conecting flight. Had to wait in line for over 2 hours with a toddler in order to get my flight rescheduled and that was not till 9:35pm with another air line which we had to pay our luggage again because spirit didnt take care of that. One of the people i was traveling with didnt even get reserved for the flight after being told she was and had to rush back to Spirit to have them book before we missed that flight. Spirit said they would reimburse all our fees for luggage that we paid and never did, and the luggage fee they have is more than double to other airlines and only accept 40lbs. It was the worst experience of my life and we all ended up sick even my toddler and was uncomfortable the entire time and sleep deprived. Wouldn't recommend this Airline to anyone.  They even charge you for water.",Negative

I realize it was the weather that diverted my plane however how everything was handled afterwards was a complete disaster. First off, the flight attendants can barely speak English and the other Spirit employees I can barely understand when they make announcements. After we got off the plane after diverting to another airport we waited in line for 3 HOURS to get tickets for another flight the next day and receive a hotel voucher for the night. It was the most inefficient way of handling this situation. Not a single Spirit employee communicated with others in the line what was going on. At the front ticketing, they took their time, made small talk, and one employee even had the audacity to say out loud ""I need a 15 min break"" and then proceeded to walk outside and smoke a cigarette. Ridiculous, especially when you have an entire plane of people that need new flights for the next day and virtually no one else behind the counter helping to begin with. The employees were incompetent. No direction as to what lines were for what.  No communication updating the long line of people. Slow. Again, it took 3 hours to move through that line. Unreal.

God forbid a tragedy occur and I have to pull a hatch I paid extra to sit by.  I booked the flight thru Priceline not knowing of the extra costs incurred upon flying this airline.  I blame that solely on Priceline, well myself also for not checking on airline.  Crew was wonderful, plane was clean.  Pack a drink and snacks otherwise take a credit card for a water or snack in flight.  Flight was on time and made destination 25 minutes early.

My flight was delayed due to ""weather"" although the other lines going to Dallas weren't delayed. I know because I checked the weather and flight status while waiting 4 hours to be told I would miss my connecting flight and to go to the ticket counter. After 15-20 minutes or so I receive a card with the reservation phone number to request a refund that could take 7 business days. They didn't accommodate anyone but also couldn't explain why if it was raining and storms over Dallas going through Missouri that the plane there wasn't delayed. It was clear skies between Arizona, New Mexico and Texas....how is that this is the plane that's  delayed?",Negative

So I called spirit to cancel it only to find out that once you are charged it's over. They don't refund the money. It is common courtesy to refund someone if they forget to cancel they're membership and all good airlines do that. So annoyed. I will never do business with spirit ever again.,Negative
8353,"I have flown Spirit for years. Domestic and International. I fly it at least ten to 15 times a year, if not more. People complaining about being charged for everything do not understand the purpose of low cost airlines. If you want to go this route, and take advantage of the low cost, then you don't bring a bag, a carry on, over weight luggage, over sized luggage and when you check in you get charged because you act surprised they do that. W T F.  You can't get through the website without ignoring or purchasing everything or lying about what you got then complaining when you get caught. Are they 5 Stars, no, but for what you PAY for, it is a solid 4. I love flying them, because even with purchasing the extra bags, the carry ons and the big front seats, (which is the only way I will go), my ticket prices to South America or New Orleans, Fort Lauderdale or Vegas, are always half the price of the other airlines. I love flying Southwest as well, But only if it is 2 hours or less. Can't do the seats for much longer. But those prices just can't be beat.",Postive

Then they were so slow to reply (I mean days) that it completely stressed me out so that I felt pressured to pay the extra £90 costs. Following that the booking numbers weren’t all correct which meant I had to deal with them again. Lengthy delays to responses on email, no reply to chat messages and I have to call Washington to try and speak to them. SXSW has been cancelled due to coronavirus and I contacted them to ask about changing my flights in light of this. I emailed straight away and got a response saying they couldn’t change my flights and if I cancelled there is no refund. I had already spoken to delta, JetBlue and virgin who had told me they could either give me credit or change my flights at no cost. JetBlue and delta did that for me straight away and changed the details so things are in my name. But virgin refused to as it was booked through this travel agency. I’ve spoken to them online and on the phone and they’re adamant that it has to come from the travel agent. The travel agent refused to help, no response to chat messages or emails. I called Washington and they just tried to make more money out of me, they didn’t even try to speak to virgin about their current policies due to the coronavirus outbreak. The called the staff member out on this and she put the phone down on me. Subsequent calls were not answered or were transferred to a voicemail that was in Spanish and that I couldn’t understand. Never have I seen such failings at customer service which could potentially affect my health. With their current stance I’m stranded in the US / Canada for two weeks away from home and insurance won’t pay out as foreign office advice doesn’t say don’t travel and flights aren’t cancelled.

Does this airline really have no clue what its potential customers want?  Do they honestly think no one flies naked (no luggage and no way to book it online if booking via a third party)?  If you make the mistake of booking via a third party (because they are MUCH cheaper), not only will you NEVER get a confirmation from Spirit (but you should), you won't be able to book luggage either through your third party or directly with Spirit because you won't ever get a confirmation number that Spirit recognizes!  And don't bother trying to contact them via email because they never answer you with the actual information you asked for.  Instead, they send you the same Bullsh*t they post online.

8374,"AUGUST 26, 2019 Out of all the airlines on planet earth, Spirit Airlines is the  h...e airline of them all!  I spent 12 hours....yes 12 hours  at the NOLA airport waiting to get home to Dallas. First of all,  what was supposed to be a 1.35 hour flight turned into a 12 hour nightmare! Second, a ticket that initially cost $325, turned into damn near $900 in baggage fees!! ONLY REASON THERE IS A STAR FOR THIS REVIEW, IS BECAUSE I HAD TO SELECT IT TO WRITE THIS POST! Departing from DFW to NOLA, was ok. The flight was on time no problem to get to our ship in NOLA and  spent 7 glorious days on a Caribbean vacation that was spectacular! WHERE OUR VACATION TURNS TO THE DARKSIDE Trying to get home is where the nightmare began! We arrived at the airport at 10 am after our ship docked around 8:00 am. After arriving to the airport, We tried checking in, but was denied because we were told that we couldn't go to our gate until 4 hours before departure,  (DFW doesn't have those restrictions from the many past experiences I've had), so we had no choice but to wait outside the terminal. 4 hours later we got through the TSA terminal and our plane was on time when we arrived at the gate. 45 minutes after arriving the flight to Columbus, OH got delayed and their flight got changed to 1:00 AM departure because the plane at their gate was sitting with mechanical problems, but our flight was still on time. 1 hour later, Spirit offered the Columbus passangers vouchers for food....our flight got delayed slightly too .... the plane we were to take was behind taking off from  Baton Rouge....30 minute flight to NOLA. Suddenly our flight was pushed out to a 1:01am departure. To make a long story short, the plane for Dallas was diverted to take Columbus guest home. But the airline's employees where lying or there supervisors were lying to us saying there was weather related issues (weatherbug was clear between Baton Rouge and NOLA) What they did was lye! They routed a plane from Las Vegas to NOLA to take us back to Dallas because Spirit ran out of functional planes and they kept giving us lame tail stories on why our plane that as only 1/2 hour away supposedly having issues with the weather,  but the storm had passed away hours ahead of the flight and all clear.....oh years gave us an update stating the plane was in route and over Arazona 2 hours away! Spirit tried offering food vouchers when they knew the restaurants in the airport were closed...offered bulls_it pizza (2 slices max). Our flight schedules to arrive in Dallas at 3:00 am! The only reason we got vouchers us because my husband and I insisted they do the same offer as the Columbus OH passengers received...And one lady in particular was so stanky with her attitude I just gave those stupid vouchers back! Never ever ever will I fly this lame liq budget Airline again...you get what you pay for. Had I spent the same money on American I could be in my bed resting at 11:00 pm.

But since that flight was delayed my layover in Boston was delayed. Which again I would have been fine with. BUT I was waiting at the gate that EVERY teleprompter said my flight was leaving from for a little over an hour. It was getting really close to the time the screen said my flight was leaving but I hadn't seen anything boarding for my destination at that gate. I was charging my phone at the time and turned it on to see if I could figure it out on my own.... spirit had sent me an email (which I received about 15 minutes before looking at it) which said that my flight was leaving from a different gate (screen said gate B28 email said B38) I checked my email a little before 1pm. It said my flight was leaving from gate B38 at 1:40 and boarding would end 15 mins before. I walked over to the correct gate which took me about 5 minutes. I sat and waited there for a couple minutes looking around to find ANYTHING that signaled my flight was at that gate. Quickly I realized it wasn't and went to ask a airport staff member. He looked at my boarding pass and told me ""that flight left 15 minutes ago"". When I talked to the very rude Spirit ""manager"" after explaining everything and trying to figure out why this happened she told me the only thing she could do for me was 1. send me on the next flight to a different city nearby(arrive around 11pm) or 2.wait until the next morning at 9am to fly direct. I had paid for a hotel already and didn't have much money to play around with. Well my hotel stops check ins at 9pm.... there was no way I was making that. I asked if they could accommodate me and was told to call their customer service. So I called and again got a very rude woman ""helping"" me. I asked to speak to her upper and she was giving me sass until she finally caved and transferred me over to her supervisor. I explained what had happened and he said the best they could do was cancel my return flight and refund me $64..... Which in the end would force me to buy a different return flight spending even more on that flight than they were willing to refund. In the end I made it to my destination.. at about 1am....

The passport details were also incorrectly copied to the booking with the data entered having no correlation at all to the entered data.  I spoke with BA who said that the booking must be corrected by CTRIP and that they should contact the Trade Desk.  I spoke with CTRIP and they said it was not possible in the time available, it would take 3 to 5 days to resolve.  CTRIP said I should cancel the booking and I would be refunded 10% of the price.  I could then book another flight with CTRIP.  I had to book another flight, direct with BA and lost my money with CTRIP.

8386,"------------- UPDATE: ------------- After posting my review earlier today, CTrip contacted me and within hours had issued my flight ticket. ---------------------------- ORIGINAL REVIEW: ---------------------------- Booked a flight to Hong Kong for my wedding next February, and I was told that it was taking longer to issue tickets and that it would take up to 24 hours. A day and a half later, there was still no contact from CTrip and no tickets. I contacted CTrip and they told me that my name was too long so they hadn't been able to process the booking. Worse still, the fare class was sold out and the next cheapest seat tickets were $1280 more expensive, so CTrip is currently (supposedly) trying to ""negotiate"" with the airline. I was told Wednesday evening that it would be sorted by today (Monday), and that they would either upgrade my seat on Cathay Pacific or get me a seat on ANA. It's now nearly 5 pm on Monday and no resolution is in sight, and the result of a phone call today is that I should ""be patient"", meanwhile potential alternative flights continue to increase in cost. Although CTrip have assured me that they will get me on a flight on the 22nd that arrives on the 22nd (this is important for me to be in HK enough days before my wedding for me to be allowed to marry), the reviews here suggest that any promises they make are empty. I'm seriously considering purchasing an alternative flight direct with an airline to ensure I can get to my wedding on time, and then follow up with CTrip through my bank and fiancée's solicitor in Hong Kong. Either way, it looks like I'm going to be seriously out of pocket thanks to CTrip!",Postive

Stop over was 40 minuets now reduced to 20 minuets meaning we would not make our connecting flight. There are no other flights close to the time so I requested a full refund so I can rebook. Still not processed, still waiting for a reply. Fobbing me off and saying they are waiting for a response from the airline. They took my money and are not providing me with what i paid for!",Negative
8388,"After filling in my card and passport details, I was given an email saying ""it is taking longer than usual to finalise your booking"" and then finally given an email confirmation, with a confirmation number. But that wasn't the actual e-ticket of the flight, and the email says that the ""ticket will be issued no later than 72 hours before the flight"". That is quite strange, because why wouldn't they issue an actual ticket when the payment has gone through already? Are they not sure that they'll actually have a ticket come the time for the flight, and say the flight has been cancelled or they are not able to give me ticket for the price advertised, like so many of the stories I have read here on TrustPilot? Given the reviews I have read here (which I should have read before booking, so many regrets now) I am now very worried there won't be a ticket when it is actually 72 hours before the flight, and by that time, it will cost so much more to buy another ticket. Booking on CTrip has given me no peace of mind whatsoever.. Next time, I would go with another booking site that actually gives you the ticket, for sure, after you book, even if it costs more.",Negative

Tried to call the service line and they said the double rooms have been sold out and I got no other choice. And it's not done yet. Ctrip overcharged me for the rooms. Sent an email to the customer service email on 27 Nov to ask for refund and got a instant reply saying I will receive a reply within 24 hours. But I have not received anything so far. Then I called the customer service line and tried to seek assistance. The lady argued with me that they didnt overcharge and blamed that it's the bank. I told them I have got the bank statement, booking number and everything to prove (I don't know why I have to argue with them tho since they must have my record) she asked me to send an email again and I receive the same email again saying I will get a reply in 24 hours.

So I easily managed to find their contact details, which was a 24hr WiFi call service, meaning it is free to call their China office. That was very helpful. Although on hold for 6mins which is quite standard and maybe even speedy when compared to other telephone call centres, they politely talked me through security and changed the details, and patiently waited for me to receive my email booking confirmation. Ctrip is a highly reputable company based in Shanghai China. I believe that is where already the negativity of people's experiences lie. They've made huge strides in making booking easy and helpful over the years, and I would use them again. Although unsure of the numbers, I would say Ctrip is one of the biggest travel agent websites in the world, so they're no scam. Just because they're not a British based company, doesn't mean it is a scam.",Postive

So I didn’t mind the delay on take off ..flight out was great and Linda was very friendly and helpful ( Monday 25th from Heathrow at 9.15 ish ) and flight back dispite the delay was a pleasant trip thanks to Mike and Nolon whom were very friendly and got food and drinks to customers as quick as possible ... ( 7pm flight from NY to LHR ) as I travel a number of times a year and have used many different airlines I’ve found Delta to be the best by far. Lots of leg room ,comfy seats and great entertainment... as I work at T5 a BA terminal I always tell my customers that delta is a great airline when they have a upset with BA .. also the food is very good unlike the rest of the airlines. You get a cocktail just after take off and I had shrimp which  was amazing and never before seen on any other airlines menu. Also my daughter is cabin crew for BA but I still stand by my word and think Delta is one of the best airlines going. Would highly recommend..",Postive

Aside from my jewelry for the exhibit, I made small sculptures for my rings to be displayed on that were also for sale, and were difficult to make. I didn’t want to mail them for fear they’d be destroyed, or not get there in time. I packed everything with plenty of bubble wrap, etc. When boarding I was told there was no room left in the overhead compartments, there were still quite a few people behind me. I explained/pleaded with her that I had to carry it on board because it was fragile, it was my artwork for an exhibit. She ROLLED HER EYES. She pried it out of my grasp with her voice raised saying “NO!” through her teeth. I had no choice, I felt. I boarded. People behind me has their bags. What the heck? Getting ready to take off, I saw the compartment opposite me with just one coat. A flight attendant asked if she could take my coat and stow it in the upper compartment above me, I asked if there was room “Oh, lots!”. I got my luggage when I arrived, opened it at my destination......I had to work all night to repair,  at least 85% had been damaged. THEN, like a dummy, I forgot my coat in that upper compartment....I immediately went to customer service. I explained to the woman behind the counter, she without hesitation told the guy next to her to retrieve it for me. He stood up, fists clenched at his side and in an audible under his breath voice said “F@*k!!!”. Then he passed the buck on the phone. I had to wait two hours. In the meantime, when I had asked an hour later about my coat, he got pissy with me. So I called him on his behavior...he was mad the other woman asked him to do it and that I should’ve known that she was not in charge. Wait, what?? How am I to know that?! Nobody had tags explaining rank. I ask how I was to know and who is in charge. He replied “We’re ALL in charge!”. We went around in circles.....How am I suppose to know THAT?! I used to like Delta.

She said no your not getting a whole bottle. I said no the small ones. She said I'm not going all the way up front to get you one. I said when one of those bigger bottles get low can I get one of those so I can give some water to the cat. She said cups only. The answer was a big NO for a small bottle without a valid explanation.

They should provide a bus to send the passengers to a hotel but they choose to give difficulty to passenger and the passenger will stay in airport and save the hotel money for Delta!

There are around 10 people wait for hotel room and the rude agent was #1 slow in my memory to check in one room in US until I asked him: no room or why?

We are already in a modern world and I believed the hotels now can see their vacant rooms in one glance. I shouldn’t have trusted this agency, it is very incompetent. This is the first time i get a booking which confirmation of booking takes forever with your money deducted on my account. It is very troublesome!!!!! I hope ctrip will not give me a false hope.",Negative
8443,"Horrible company. I booked a hotel in London and when I arrived they had no idea who I was, they tried searching for my name multiple times and could not find me anywhere. I immediately called my credit card company and asked that the charge for the hotel from Ctrip be reversed. When I returned from abroad Ctrip contacted me requesting a valid reason for this and I told them that I was unable to stay at the hotel. However, all of the sudden the hotel had confirmation of my booking and I still have to pay the amount for the hotel that I didn't even stay at. Ctrip customer service kept threataning me that they were going to cotact creditors and take out a lawsuit on me. I understand that at all of the sudden when I returned from London the hotel had my booking but when I tried to check into the hotel I was unable to do so and Ctrip was not even willing to entertain this idea.",Negative
8444,"I booked a ticket this morning for the Xmas holidays from London to Orlando and back. As the posts below, I got a confirmation email with a reference number and I was rather concerned when my card did not go through to the security page. I then got an email saying that it’s taking longer to finalise this booking and that I’d have to wait 24H. I immediately felt there was something wrong and looked at the reviews (which I should have done beforehand, but trusted Skyscanner) and to my horror found all the below stories. Since I was not issued an e-ticket or received further notice and it’s less than 24H I’ve decided to cancel the booking. I called them and they said I should expect a whole refund within 10 days - which is rather ludicrous since I haven’t even received a ticket. I cincerely hope this isn’t a scam and expecting them to keep their word. I just can’t believe they take people’s money like that!! I will update in due course...",Negative

My money was taken immediately and then I received an email to say 'its taking longer than usual to finalise your booking'. I have emailed Ctrip to ask where my confirmation is, and received no reply, however after reading these reviews it looks unlikely my flight was ever booked! This is ridiculous, I need someone to call me straight away and let me know whether I need to alter my travel plans. I can imagine the flights have gone up in price by the time I find out if I need to rebook. GUTTED! You only need to read their bland responses from all of these poor reviews to see their low level of customer care and service!",Negative
8446,"*UPDATE* 2 stars instead of 1.  After i posted the review below, trip.com contacted me and due to the review, finally refunded me the money. Whilst i was happy to finaly recieve what was rightfully mine, it was sad that they couldn't provide good customer service in the first place and only offered my money back after their reputation was being tarnished online. If they had done so, I wouldn't have written such a bad review and wouldnt feel so bitter towards them. Once again, while I appreciate the refund, I would never book through them again, its just not worth the stress. CON ARTISTS! Absolutely horrendous! I booked my flights through Ctrip to go to Lisbon from London via TAP Portugal for my friend's bachelorette party. The incompetent people at Ctrip booked my flights with a spelling error in my name, as a result, the airline cancelled my flight and I only found out the day before I was due to fly when i went to check in. After going back and forth between the agency and the airline for 3 hours, the agency finally said they would contact the airline and call me when the issue was resolved.  I didn't get a call back, only a poorly written, one sentence email that made no sense at all. In the morning I called the agency again livid about what had happened, and demanded another flight that day or my money back. They had the audacity to say they had fixed the issue and ""informed"" me and that it was my fault for not going to the airport. They refused to give my money back, even though it was completely their fault!!!! AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!!!",Negative

8472,"I used to regard Qatar Airways as an excellent airline for customer service and inflight experience. That idea has been desimated by the type of dishonesty and disregard that would put Ryan Air to shame. I tried to book my ticket home to the UK from India for 20th March on the Qatar Website. Upon attempting payment their website came up with a message saying payment screen time out and to try to book again. I tried again on the website and got another error message. Due to the COVID situation and prices rising by the minute (it had gone up by £20 in quite literally 10minutes) - I tried to call them to ensure that payment hadn't been taken and wait to see if I received any email. At that point money had not been debited from my account. I called their customer care line and was on hold for a long time at cost to myself. I was ultimately hung up on before I could receive help. I waited a little bit longer but nothing happened. Due to trusting the message I saw on the website, which stated that PAYMENT HAD TIMED OUT AND THAT I SHOULD RETRY BOOKING, I did just that on a 3rd party website because theirs seemed to be experiencing issues. I did so. A substantial amount of time later, to my horror I receive a confirmation email for the ticket they had told me I hadn't been successful in booking. I then emailed, tried to call multiple times and got no response. No service. Nothing. This also cost me money. I thought I would travel on the second ticket so that they could refund me the original. I put in a refund request explaining everything but was once again ignored by the ""award winning"" airline. I then received an updated e-ticket for the second ticket which had the WRONG NAME on it even though the original had the correct one. This was not done by the ticket agent. I called to check that I could still travel on it. No one answered. I have put in a complaint. The first response I got addressed nothing. It was misspelled and quite frankly unprofessional. I responded to it saying it was not an adequate response. What came instead of a better reply was a ruder one. Avoid this company. They will lie to you, steal from you and then treat you like trash.

Not only is it visible, but it's a different color then the background. The velcro is nice and strong and grips very well. However, it too is a different color than the base purchased one.

Jetstar will not issue a refund despite not being able to fulfil their end of the purchase agreement within a reasonable timeframe, and are instead only offering a voucher that I do not want or need now. Every time I have spoken to them online (they don’t have customer service over the phone) they have said bad weather is outside their control and so don’t issue refunds - despite their own terms and conditions saying that refunds are considered on a case by case basis. This advice seems to contradict consumer rights information available on the ACCC website on refunds and replacements. Having seen a lot of the other reviews on here I can see now that this is not uncommon. The customer service isn’t great, and they’re not really that much cheaper than a standard airline anyway. Don’t bother if you can avoid them.",Negative
8553,The rude lady at baggage carry on weighed 4 of our bags together for 4 people to accumulate 1 kg extra and charge 65 dollars . They took my wife's purse to weigh as well. Disgusting service in Sydney.  Didn't have this problem coming from cairns,Negative

Flight from Alicante to London ""delayed"" 14 hours on the first of July then cancelled with no alternative flight offered 4 hours after the initial ""delay"" leaving us stuck in Spain. Spent over an hour on hold trying to speak with a member of customer services then had phone call disconnected. Its now been 27 days since we contacted the airline by email seeking a refund and the compensation we are legally entitled to and have had absolutely no response from the airline. Have also just heard of a friend who had their flight to Canada from London cancelled at very late notice and is also struggling to get her compensation. Avoid flying with Primera Air at all costs, they'll take your money and give you nothing in return.",Negative
8589,"I paid more for the flight to have a direct London to Newark. The company did not notify us till after we all boarded the plane that we were stopping over in Iceland to refuel (we overheard the staff saying it was because the company wanted to save money by using a smaller plane that couldn’t do a transatlantic flight - which was not the Boeing we all booked) - therefore not giving us any opportunity to change plans or figure out connections and trains. (Against EU regulations) In lieu of the changes - the flight staff did nothing to ease the inconvenience to the point that they wouldn’t even give people a glass of water to take medication The airline never once issued a Apology email to let their customers know they were aware of the inconvenience. After I emailed the company to notify them Of the issues they replied back with “Primera Air has reviewed the claim and would like to apologize one more time for any inconveniences caused.  However, Primera Air disagrees with the claim” It’s a bummer that They genueiney don’t care about you as a customer. Unfortunately I Won’t be flying with them again",Negative

Or better yet, choose a trustworthy Company altogether would be my advice.",Negative

TSA agents were laughing at us because they said this happened every night, and their neighbors, SPIRIT air said the same--just the worst.  They throw every inconvenience at you to make sure you don't make the flight--no online check in, no printing boarding pass, and a desk team that skirts out early on the regular.  No one to talk to at customer service.  we had to book a new flight so the ""deal"" was no deal at all and ended up costing us an arm and a leg more in travel expenses.  WORST.",Negative
8595,"I flew on the transatlantic flight PF43 from Stansted to Boston Logan. Primera air lost two of my checked-in luggage, which I understand, but what is inexcuasble is that their customer service is truly terrible. Their partner company skyteam at Boston Logan airport did a terrible job of filing my lugagge claim, they basically neglected ever putting it in the online missing luggage system. I have always flown Norwegian (monthly) on this route and I decided to try out Primera for the first time this month, I truly regret it now. It is extremely hard to reach Primer's customer service staff on the phone and they DO NOT reply to emails in a timely manner. I am appalled at how they treat their customers. And if I were Primera management, I would review Boston Logan's skyteam desk staff performance.",Negative

From reading other trust pilot reviews I'm in for a long long wait. Do your self a favour don't take the chance it's not worth it.,Negative
8597,"I had to write this review as I was literally petrified to fly with PA after reading the reviews. I  was even trying to buy additional travel insurance. I arrived at Stansted with much trepidation. Check in was easy and I paid to be upgraded (again, terrified I would be in a seat with 5 inches of leg room). The staff were very polite, boarding efficient - no issues with bags being shoved into containers, etc. The plane was brand new, the on board staff so helpful and friendly. Dillon, the purser, was cheerful and professional- a real gem onboard. The airline food was frankly just edible but I bought food with me. The plane was on time in Boston and I can honestly say arriving in the US at night is much better to help overcome jetlag. I would advise taking a small pillow though.",Postive
8598,"I try to fly budget whenever I can. On this basis, I booked to see my friends in the USA with Primera –– flying from Stansted to Newark. There was no entertainment, so if you do choose to fly with them make sure you put MORE than enough entertainment in your own hands. No entertainment for 7+ hours is ridiculous. There was a horrendous smell whenever the air con blew out 'fresh' air. If that wasn't bad enough, this is the bad part! An hour or so before landing, the pilot says that there's a storm over Newark, so he'll keep us updated. Give it half an hour and he says ""the storm is still there, so we may have to land at Stewart, but we only have twenty minutes of fuel left."" At this point us passengers are confused, why would you say you have less fuel than needed –– that's a way to make people panic! Twenty minutes pass and he says ""the storm is still there, but we're just gonna have to give landing a go."" We didn't even know where we were landing into! I flew Norweigan in Jan, if you want to fly budget to New York then go with them – so much better. Touch screen ordering food, free entertainment, no bad smells and a panic free flight!",Negative

8610,"Had flights booked to New York back in May which were cancelled. It took some chasing to get Primera Air to arrange flights with another airline which I could have done without, but eventually they put us on a flight with Norwegian Air (who I have to say are a great airline!) We did have to fly out a day earlier, which meant additional costs for a hotel room. As per Primera Air's compensation policy, they will contribute 150 euros towards additional hotel costs. It is now two months since our trip and I am still chasing the 150 euros. I have provided them with all the details requests (hotel receipt) and still I am no further down the line! I have sent over 10 emails, and even tried calling their phone number (was on hold for 20minutes then I gave up). This is not an airline that puts it's customers first.",Negative

Flight attendants very rude when asked for water, which in trans Atlantic flights is not given out except to people who order very expensive meals.",Negative

8614,"I do not have an option of giving a negative star rating, so that is probably saving some grace but this airline company is stingy. More than being stingy, it is highly inefficient. They wouldn't offer even water for their guests and pre-ordering meals is not available online. You wouldn't even know that the meals must be ordered at the check-in! Coming to the hosts in the aircraft - not sure why they are understaffed. And because they are understaffed, to attend to their guests will take forever. On a flight that is almost 8 hour long, I wouldn't imagine that minimum things like water, or some light snacks are not served. All that we wanted to have, had to be purchased. While it is great that there is an option of making the purchase, we had to wait for eternity for the hosts to attend us. And by the time the hosts attended us, after attending other guests, nothing was available. The only thing available was some rice noodles, which to say the least was horrible. One last statement - only this company can compete with itself for being inefficient. Period.",Negative
8615,"Primera Air cancelled our flight on June 2 for technical reason and to this day of July 18, I have not heard anything from them and I have not received a refund. They said they will respond in 30 days and it is far past that time. I had submitted the receipts and boarding pass that was required and all I got is the auto response email that they received my email. So after emailing and calling in on several occasions being on hold over an hour, today I finally spoke with a rep over the phone. I told her the reason of my call and she says ""things like this takes a long time and that I need to wait a little longer"". She never asked my name, or booking number to look into the case. She just told me to wait a little longer. I would not recommend this airline. This was my first time with them and my last for sure. I paid for a flight I never took because of their fault.",Negative
8616,"Absolutely SHOCKING!!!! Do not travel with Primera Air under any circumstances - They are a truly abysmal. To being, the delays are unreal - i flew Newark to London and a quick google search will show you how badly almost every flight is delayed. That is if you are lucky enough to not be cancelled. The staff at the airports are rude, they do not have a clue what is happening, they are so uninformed. They do not even try to help! Customer Service - this is the worst part - There is none. They do not respond to any emails. Since they started flying transatlantic and completely ruined their own reputation they have removed any form of contact number from their website!! Claiming for delays is just impossible, i requested compensation 3 months ago for my delays and am still to receive a response. DO NOT FLY WITH THIS AIRLINE!!!!",Negative

Sent an email 16th June to chase it up received another back on the 18th June stating to quote "" thank you for your mail please allow some days for the transaction to clear. Thank you in advance for your patience in this respect"" now patience is actually my middle name no joke and I used to have some before Lufthansa started LYING to their customers and myself. Well today is 20th June still no money in my account so I rang up the call centre was one in Manila Philippines even though I'm in the UK at least she could speak English good start this is where is all goes wrong. She tells me after giving her my booking reference that my refund is still in the queue and hasn't even been near the refund team or even been processed at all so basically the customer relations person who sent the two emails to me has LIED twice to me saying that it had been processed and that in was coming to my account. Lufthansa are basically a bunch of LIERS who are trying to get away with everything as they just clearly don't care about there customers at all to the point they won't have any left by the end of this whole saga.

They gave me a Venice-Addis (via frankfurt) but said I had to pay 66€ more. So the total for this return flight is 576€. While talking to the operator I surfed the website, and see that that flight has two fares: *  390,38 EUR  BASIC FARE *  586,38 EUR  BASIC PLUS so it was clear to me that the operator did not choose the cheapest: I asked and he said: YES, I selected the cheapest for you: I said: ""but the website is about 200€ cheaper"", he said that it could be the cost depends on the fact that I changed the city, so I said OK.

8644,"Using Skyscanner and travel2be we had the choice between several airlines for my trip to Auckland... Alas we chose Swiss/Lufthansa over a Chinese airline which was twice cheaper and had safe aircrafts because we thought that in case of any problem, we'd be safer. We were wrong. A ""priority service"" was automatically added and billed and I learnt that it was non refundable although the service was not provided since the june flight was obviously cancelled so that best case scenario only 85% of the flight ticket is refundable. As a French schoolboy, the month of june in seconde was the only time that was both convenient for the family that would welcome me and myself. Next year, I'll be in première, working for my bac de Français. We thus asked for a refund and travel2be and skyscanner told us they were powerless as Swiss/LUFTHANSA ignored their emails. You'll have understood, we're pretty much disgusted with Swiss/LUFTHANSA which is an airline totally devoid of empathy...The fact I was going at the other end of the world under very specific circumstances makes absolutely no difference (we cc ed them but to no avail) Qatar airways refunds in 7 days, BA and Finn air are pretty quick at refunding too, had my parents chosen the Chinese airline, they'd already had their refund and could have bought me a nice substitute gift (it was my birthday and Xmas gift) Don't make the same mistake ! They make no exception in their no refund policy !",Negative
8645,"Lufthansa has joined a bunch of greedy companies and expects to be rescued by public money. Tried to cancel my ticket for refund as travel to that region is still not opened up. After a brief announcement of ""your call is important to us"" followed by an announcement of 20 mins wait time, a strange beep, and then goes silent. Thier is no indication if you are still connected and what the progress is in the virtual queue. Invest in some proper call handling telephony system else you are not winning customers.",Negative
8646,"The worst airline ever. I paid 6900 kr for 3 tickets to Barcelona so I could attend to my grandmother's funeral, I called the Lufthansa company and the Spanish embassy to make sure, that I can travel to Spain and there was no problem. Arriving at the airport in Copenhagen, the Lufthansa employee says that we can not travel to Spain due to Covid-19. HOW can a Airline sell tickets, IF we are not allowed to travel to the country?!!! When I contact their customer service, I am told that they can change my tickets for 3000 kr. extra, and If I do not pay them, then I will lose my tickets. They are smart at finding ways to get as much money out of their customers as possible. LIANEE from customer service in the Philippines refused and give me her boss name so we could find a solution. They are in no way cooperative. this company is full of corruption.",Negative

Bad!",Negative
8649,"Great, nonexistent customer service that's an absolute disgrace for such a big, international airline company. Not only do they give you the run around by avoiding your calls and emails, they like to tell you what you want to hear over the phone, then refuse to put it in writing on an email. No proper information, no help other than the generic copy paste answers, no refunds - forget about travelling with this company who clearly do not have their customers' interests at heart. P.S: You might want to rehire some new customer advisors in the Germany call center - the ones I have spoken to have no customer service or basic phone etiquette.",Negative

I know this is is a difficult time, but it's a difficult time for everyone, and Wizzair seem to have forgotten about their customers. The only way of getting in contact with their customer support is by calling a premium number, how can this even be legal? Trying to profit from your customers on something like this is such a shameful behavior.",Negative
8688,"They do the worst thing you can do to treat customers- tell lies. Refund requested 17th April, they say this will be paid within 60 days so should have been received 14th June.

8689,I made a complaint regarding my flight from London To Budapest. It was suppose to be a short break but our hotel cancelled and flight back to London was cancelled and in London by goverment laws non essential travel was suggested to be cancelled and additionally we have to isolate 2 weeks in the U.K. it is not fare that the only option we had was to cancel but i was told by customer service that a fee of 80£ per person would be made which is so high there was no point. Im extremely dissapointed on your lack of support during these times during a pandemic. i purchase the ticket before the Pandemic in febuary. I was told to wait to see if the flight would be cancelled by Wizz Air but the flight was confirmed. We also could not fly as Hungary was only allowing Hungarian passport to be allowed to enter the country.it was suppose to be the first time flying with Wizz Air and you have left me and probably many passengers with a extremely bad experience. Shame on you! its so dissapointing how Wizz has decided to handle these difficult times. I had flighs booked with other airlines who went out of there way to give the clients an option of credit to fly when its safe or a refund was offered. I will make sure I communicate to all friends and family to avoid this airline as you have no care in the world for the safety of the clients. i was not  to fly into a country where i would be denied entry .,Negative
8690,"They refused to let a bunch of people on to flight because they claimed that the destination airport would only accept residents.  We later found out that was utter nonsense - other flights with other airlines were just fine.  Staff were rude and we had to wait two hours just to get out of the airport. The worse thing is their customer service which is a nightmare.  If you call them it costs 1,45/min and the you just get rude aggressive people with really poor English who refuse to do anything.. They then said it was my fault as I didn't turn up for the flight and I could get a refund minus £160 for a no show fee. I will never use them again..",Negative
8691,"Flown with wizzair over 80 times and never had a problem with their customer service. Since Covid 19 their customer care policy has changed dramatically, they now use any excuse to keep your money and the slightest excuse to charge for hidden extras or percieved booking errors is taken. Customer care representatives have become blunt bordering on rude and will terminate your call when you ask them to comply with the Consumer Rights Act 2015 and Consumer Contracts Regulations 2014. Really sad that their need for money is being fed by illegal practises that WILL now lead to numerous County Court actions against them, including mine.",Negative
8692,"In terms of flight quality and aircraft quality they are ok. But as a business entity and customer service they are crooks and authorities shall investigate their behavior. They sent me an email that my my flight was cancelled and they have re-booked me on another flight. This is fine. But I have to accept the new booking online. I did the process by signing in, accepting the conditions, choosing my seat, but the final acceptance button didn't work. Tried 50 times, it didn't work. Just a screen flash, the page didn't advance, the warning to accept the change remained there. Finally I had to call them, but they kept me on hold for 15 minutes. Of course, because they provide a premium number even for local call which is 8 times the rate of the normal local rate. At the end, as suggested by the customer service, I wanted to submit a complaint and a refund request online, but of course, that doesn't work either. Nothing happens when you click the submit button. These crooks are collecting now money through their premium phone call rate.",Negative

When my flights were cancelled by WizzAir, they proposed three suggestions - rebook (no-no), get 120% credit on your account (thanks but no thanks) or 100% refund on the original booking. I selected the refund option and supplied them with the flight reference, international banking numbers etc. A couple of days later I got what appeared to be an invoice/credit note showing a reversal of the amount I paid - good I thought, refund is on the way. Only found out today that WizzAir had credited my WizzAir account instead of giving me a refund. I've complained but I'm not hopeful.",Negative

8706,Customer service is absolute shambles! I contacted Wizz Air on 15/06/20 at regarding my booking to enquire what my cash refund would be if I were to cancel my flights. The agent I was speaking to confirmed that an amount of £1221.00 would be refunded back to my credit card. The difference between what I actually paid £1609  is what they are charging as a cancelation charge. The agent further clarified that the amount of £1221.00  would be credited to my credit card account within 2/3 weeks. Upon being given this information and only because this information was given to me I agreed to cancel my booking.  Shortly after cancelling the aforementioned booking I made an entirely new booking for the same flight & date for only £670.00.  I called Wizz Air again just to re-confirm that I should expect the refund to my credit card no later that within 2/3 weeks only to be told that the agent I spoke to on 15/06/20 with whom based on the information they had given me & proceeded to cancel my original flights with had in fact given me incorrect information & that I would not be receiving a refund to my credit card but instead the amount of £1221 would be credited to a Wizz Account and that I would need to use this credit within 3 months!! This agent proceeded to advise me that Wizz Air cannot be held responsible for a colleagues error which is an absolute ridiculous & totally unacceptable statement to be made Under a legal doctrine an employer is legally responsible for the actions of its employees. Without the refund as promised by Wizz Air our whole holiday is now in jeopardy in addition we stand to lose our deposit for the accommodation which was booked independently from Wizz Air as we now have only until 18/06/20 to confirm that we still want the accommodation. WizzAir have breached the agreement made with me & in addition are legally responsible for the actions of its employees. My complaint was closed as I did not respond to the confirmation email “thank you for submitting your enquiry. We will look into this further  and contact you ASAP. “ A representative by the name of Anastasia advised this is because I did not respond saying thank you! Absolute shambles !!!,Negative

8763,"In August-September 2014 Military Flight Travel helped us obtain a flight for my mother in-law to visit us from the Philippines. The return flight was due to March 23, 2015. We were in the process of asking USCIS for a 6-month extension of her stay (even though she has a 10-year entry-exit Visa) as you can only remain in-country for 6 months as a Tourist. We ended up deciding to wait on keeping my mother in-law here so we needed to change the return flight date from March 23, 2015 to April 10, 2015. When Military Flight Travel contacted the original lender they said they no longer make loans for flights to Retired Military personnel which I am. I asked them to make an exception and they refused. So Military Flight Travel had to use another lender to cover the added cost to cover the return flight change of date. That was going to require me to pay two loans and that was not feasible for me as that would have been about $60 a month more than I am currently paying. After negotiating with the new lender Military Flight Travel was able to ask the new lender to assume the previous loan and combine it with the one they did for the additional cost to change the flight. The payments remained the same as I had with the first lender. I am so happy Military Flight Travel could work that out and I owe it to a lot of hard work and persistence on the part of Mike.

8784,"In short shockingly bad customer service. As above I treated myself to a non budget airline and would have been much better off with Easy Jet. A very condensed version of the 5 weeks since being ‘bumped off’ a flight from London to Geneva. Swiss Air paid the statutory minimum compensation for this and promised me my flight would be refunded. I filled in the online form as advised but was told by customer services they would not refund my ticket. No real reason was given for this. This was a clear error on their part and when I tried to resolve it with polite, clear emails I just got back dismissive communications refusing to repay the ticket often taking a week to reply and only doing so on being nudged. Eventually taking to Twitter caused them to rethink and eventually refund as they should have done at the start. But even at this point, behind closed doors and on private message they were incredibly curt, dismissive about the time and energy I have had to spend on this. P",Negative

I was worried about the flights through the third party so I called SWISS directly and the lady on the phone was really nice and reassured me everything was fine. Online check-in was a breeze. The quality of the plane was good, the entertainment system came with a widescreen and the food is pretty much what you would expect. I have no complaints with our trip. Perhaps things need to go wrong to find out if the airline is capable, however our trip was perfect, absolutely no complaints.",Postive
8794,"FLY SWISS INTERNATIONAL AIR LINES? NO THANK YOU. This is my story about the incredible poor service I have received so far from Swiss International airlines . On Jul 12, 2019, I took Flight LX87 from Montreal. connecting in Zurich, with flight LX420 to Birmingham, where I landed on June 13th, 2019 at approx. 8:00 hrs. Unfortunately, my suitcase did not follow me. At the Birmingham Intl Airport, I promptly filled out the required Property Irregularity Report. It was determined that my suitcase had remained in Montreal but was supposed to be placed on a flight later that day to Birmingham. This was confirmed in a personal email to me. Despite continuing update request emails being sent to Montreal by the Birmingham lost baggage dept’, Montreal SWISS did not respond to any of the requests. On the morning of July 16, 2019 , I had no option but to terminate my 10 day trip to Birmingham and return to Montreal to get some answers and personally obtain my suitcase. I based my decision on the following. 1. Having been officially notified, on the same day of my arrival, that my luggage was located in Montreal and was to be sent to Birmingham on the next flight. 2. Being informed that Swiss Montreal still had not responded to the various requests from the Birmingham lost luggage department on July 13, 14, 15 and 16 re: my suitcase. This being four days after the initial request was made and despite my suitcase having been located in Montreal. 3. Being informed on the 16th that my luggage still had not arrived in Birmingham Subsequently, on July 16th I took the train at 5:30 from Birmingham to Gatwick airport with a connecting AirTransat flight TS 729 to Montreal. All this to reclaim my suitcase which was confirmed to be in Montreal, not lost, but that Swiss International airlines failed to send it to Birmingham despite multiple requests to do so. Upon my arrival in Montreal, I immediately went to the Lufthansa/Swissair Lost baggage dept. The employees manning the counter were not very helpful in locating my bag. By chance the on-floor luggage attendant overheard my conversation. She asked me whether my suitcase was blue and a hard case. When I replied, yes, she said she knew where it was. She proceeded to get it and 20 minutes later returned with my bag which had a red RUSH sign taped to the handle. Well, no one at Swiss rushed. The suitcase was never placed on a plane and they never bothered to respond to the multiple requests from the Birmingham lost baggage department. Consequently my trip to Birmingham, was completely ruined by the incompetent and inaction of Swiss personnel. As such, I am claiming full compensation for the expenses incurred on this trip: compensation for my original flight; compensation for the transportation costs of my return trip from Birmingham to Montreal, loss of Holiday enjoyment and for medical distress due to lack of my medication. So far, they have offered $407 which I refused. What incompetent and disgraceful service. THINK TWICE BEFORE FLYING SWISS INTERNATIONAL AIRLINES.",Negative
8795,"It would appear that I'm not alone judging by the large amount of reviews and the absolutely diabolical average score.  Based on this it clearly shows that Swiss senior management don't care about improving service so my review is to tell others to just use a different airline.  I booked my flight, called to make a change to the flight out and inbound details. They only updated the outbound, charged me $900! Then after 1.5 hours on the phone (two operators hung up as it was clearly two hard for them) I am still in the same position of them trying to charge me yet again for my return changes.  Their customer service is terrible. Use a different airline is my advice.  Let them loose their jobs and see if it changes their attitude towards 'us', their customers.",Negative
8796,"Beware all travellers... Never ever travel with this airlines. Me and my  family refused to travel from Heathrow by this bunch of  irresponsible, arrogant, rude staff of Swiss air I took ticket around 1 year before to travel from Heathrow to Mumbai. On the day of travelling on 8th Aug 19 I completed my check in and baggage dropped and on the way of security gate the same checking staff followed us an refused entry in to the flight because they say my kids Overseas Citizen of India life long visa stamped on the old passport. I was carrying both old and new passport but they says it will refused by Indian immigration when I reached India and there will be a fine for the airlines. Thats an  utter lie because all the other airlines allowed people to travel with the same documents. They says the new rule came in to effect 6 months. That's not true but the day itself my friends and family travel with same documents with air India.emirates etc. The counter close to swiss air was air India and I showed them my documents and for my surprise they told me no such rule and u can travel on air India with this documents.  Then I took the last minute Air India flight with premium pricing of £3500 and lost the whole ticket money £1800 I paid for Swiss airline. They are most arrogant flight company in Heathrow and the airport authorities must ban their operations from Heathrow. With out no valid reason the mental trauma caused by them while refusing travelling to the family with kids. They shattered our long awaited holiday plan. While reaching Mumbai Airport I asked the immigration officer about the rule but he says its only an advice and no such rule for refusing travelling..iwas so frustrated and disappointed after that news. When I was doing check in they never had an issue and my luggage gone to the flight. That means the counter staff not aware of this and sure that there is no issues with my documentation. After hours of waiting only I got back the luggage from flight. Insisted of helping and support passengers the Swiss Air staffs especially a lady called Priya threatened us that she will call security and removed us from airport.... Never fly with them.",Negative
8797,"Worst airline I have experienced ! Got massive delays 3 times in 3 weeks using them (my mistake , I should have never trusted this company). Customer service is non-existant and I had much better reliability using worst-in-class low-cost airlines. Just last Friday, instead of landing in London City Airport (flight LX446) they landed us in Birmingham airport ! Assistance was near zero and I was forxed to pay nearly £250 extra out of my pocket in taxi to reach the destination, and arrived over 4 hours late (for a 1h15 flight). Customer service did not care at all. Take any other airline.",Negative
8798,"Booked a ticket via 3rd party. Called Swiss to get an confirmation that luggage was included in the ticket. They confirmed. I then requested getting a written confirmation so no unnessecary hick-ups could occur upon check-in.

But refusing to send a written confirmation is simply absurd. Why only confirm verbally and refuse to send a written confirmation?",Negative

SWISS is still benefiting from the idea that swissness equals quality, That is simply no true. SWISS is not better than any low-cost carrier. The personnel is either unfriendly or unmotivated. You don't have any legroom in the 777-300 even if you're not a tall guy. It is simply impossible to pick something from the floor below your seat.

8904,"Transavia simply cannot be trusted with anyone's belongings. They misplaced my luggage and had absolutely no answers pertaining to when it would be back in my possession.  I need the things in my luggage for work, and so it is a pretty big deal that it had been lost. Not only that, the lady who checked me in at the airport in Paris was completely unprofessional/possibly racist. My gut feeling after this interaction was that it was a mistake booking a ticket with this company. Everything was just so sloppy, not an acceptable trait for any airline, really. I never should have handed my things over to these incompetent people. Moreover, the person I spoke with at their Baggage Service office in France, Gloria, also treated me poorly, blatantly mocking me for being distressed. When I did eventually receive my luggage, it clearly had been mishandled, with broken items and ruined clothing. Their call center in India is full of genuinely nice, caring & hardworking people who have absolutely no power to do anything but deal with angry customers who been mistreated by this airline. Maybe these employees should train the others on customer service, or possibly this airline should be canceled altogether. What a scam. Now reading other reviews on this site, I know I am not alone in finding this airline to be complete crap. Needless to say, I highly recommend all travelers to avoid disaster & steer clear of Transavia.",Negative

The answer was that they have not had time to look for but he would go and look at the belt now, 3,5 hours after arrival. They were there. I received it 3 hours before I left the destination. All without any help from Transavia. Total amateurs - will never use this lousy company again",Negative
8908,I have never come across such poor customer service than I did when flying with this airline this morning from Ljubljana to Amsterdam. Their excuse - ‘we are just a budget airline’. I was a KLM customer and I was shocked to read that Transavia are not only partners - it is actually owned 100% by KLM. I have always found KLM a brilliant airline with high standards and I fly with them a lot. They need to ditch Transavia or bring up the standards.,Negative
8909,"1. The pets don't have a designated room and lied about it ahen asked. 2. No one checks the pets during flight. 3. They treat your personal belongings poorly and that I witnessed myself because I happened to be there for an issue they caused. 4. Someone opened my cat's cage. Due to the way the cage was built it is not possible to open unless someone does it. There also more evidence of that fact. 5. Everything in flight is very expensive. Even water. 6. Everything is cramped up and there is not enough room. 7. They were not apologetic or helpful in resolving the cat situation. On the ogher hand their employees did an awful job at it. They were scaring the cat even more (by throwing suitcases around like rocks) and by ignoring my instructions. All in all, not worth it!",Negative

We arrived at a time Avis was closed. The next day I couldn't get the reserved car. Cartrawler wouldn't refund anything. So fully paid, no car. To me that seems theft and having a clausule stating 'if the vehicle is not released due to a late arrival no funds will be reimbursed' is illegal. Transavia did not accept any responsibility neither did Cartrawler. I advise customers to consider the risk of late arrival and the by Cartrawler as well as Transavia executed policies prior to using the link and renting a car in this way.",Negative

The staff were always friendly towards us. On the way back we experienced food poisoning (not from the airline), and the staff were very kind to us to offer us assistance with extra sick bags and checking up on us. Would have been nice if they would have offered us some water to calm our stomach.",Postive
8918,"Price was reasonable and it was easy to book online.  The round trip flights Paris to Malaga we’re fine. The air crew was nice. Check in at Paris Orly was very confusing and disorganised.  It was worse in Malaga, where we had to remind them to place tags properly on our bags, they were very sloppy and unfriendly. Sure enough, one of our bags was missing when we arrived in Paris Orly (14 July).  We filed a report immediately and called everyday for updates.  After 2-3 weeks they said my bag was found, but it’s never been sent to me.  I’ve called and emailed 20x and they don’t know what to do. The Montreal Convention requires them to reimburse for loss after 21 days, so I filed a claim with receipts and everything (hours and hours to prepare).  They haven’t paid, it’s been 90 days, and they still tell me my luggage was found and a supervisor would sort it out.  Same story every two weeks, and I have to call them! I understand lost luggage, but not finding my luggage and not paying my claim?  Worst experience in 30 years of flying.  I will not use them ever again.",Negative
8919,"Our family flew with Transavia on the 19th of August. Myself, My husband and our 3 children all under 8. My husband had booked a wheelchair assist because he had surgery on his ankle just a few weeks ago. Upon check in for our flight we were directed to go upstairs to meet the wheelchair. We tried to find it and could not. We asked another member of staff at the airport who directed us to the other side of the terminal. We could not find it. We asked another member of staff and they directed us back downstairs. At this point we decided to give up and just go through security as we were just being sent all over the airport with 3 children increasing the strain on my husband. We were under the assumption that someone at the gate may be able to help. At security we again stated that we were supposed to have a wheelchair assist. In the security line the agents took my husbands crutches to scan and did not return them to him causing him to fall before he finally got to the area to pick them up despite asking the attendants for them. When we got to the gate we saw our flight was delayed so we attempted to get staff attention to get someone to bring the wheelchair as there were no chairs available for him to sit. Staff did nothing to help for at least 30 minutes at which point they then directed him to a place he could sit. I asked the gate staff again about the wheelchair assist. They shrugged and shook their heads and continued with what they were doing. When our flight finally began the boarding process I AGAIN asked them about wheel chair assist or at least priority boarding. The woman shook her head and told my husband to stay seated. As the other passengers started boarding so he tried to get up so he could get to his seat without waiting in the line. The same woman told him to sit down. Once every other passenger was waiting to board we were then told to go wait in line. He was then forced to stand for an extended period of time at the end of the line to board. As we got toward the door of the plane the woman who had been at the desk standing near the door. I asked her how I could prevent this from happening again and she was very rude in her body language and did not answer my question and instead began turning red in the face and stormed away. When we finally got on the flight I got the attention of a flight attendant. She was incredibly helpful and informed us that yes, it was on the flight manifest that he was supposed to have an assist but that the gate staff said we never told them. But we did tell them. We asked all over the airport. At check in, at information desks, at security, at the gate multiple times. It took days for my husband to recover from what happened. I do not fault the staff on the plane as they were absolutely lovely and did all that they could to resolve the problems and made sure there was a wheel chair waiting in Sevilla. But the damage was already done by the gate staff and all the staff we had come into contact with prior to that. My husband was put through incredible amounts of pain because of the way our family was treated. I have been all over the world and this is absolutely the worst experience I have ever had with an airline. Treating a passenger who needs assistance in this manner is completely unacceptable.  I have been dealing with their customer service since then and it's been absolutely infuriating.  Getting a hold of them was a feat unto itself!  And finally making contact with ""Gloria"" didn't exactly help either.  She has been completely unhelpful and came off as down right insulting on more than one occasion.  I'm now looking up advocates for disabled rights as this could have happened to my Mum or Grandma who are both permanently disabled and I do not believe the airline is doing anything to stop this from happening again.  So no.  I will not recommend this airline until I see some actual evidence that they care about what happened and plan to fix it.",Negative

8947,"I have a lot of complaints about the quality of the customer support and the online experience the company is providing. The customer service's level of English is extremely low; they cannot understand basic English and the quality of the conversation is very poor, to such an extend that you should be given an award if you find a representative that is competent to help you resolve your issue. At the same time, the level of knowledge is different among the representatives: I had been trying to book an urgent flight for 3 hours; when I decided to change the payment method I had initially chosen, I wasn't able to complete my purchase, create a new one or have the customer service representative send the payment link because he was claiming that isn't possible. 3 phone calls later, I managed to find that god-sent representative, who was able to send me the link in order to pay for the booking (3 hours later!!!!). The website is seriously and annoyingly faulty; it's full of bugs, like the one I mentioned earlier, and a lot more. The quality of Transavia has dropped enormously, to such an extend I will reconsider flying Transavia ever again. You should look up to your mother company, KLM, and get some valuable lessons about online user experience, service and quality of representatives. All in all, avoid as much as you can!!",Negative

Then, online check in did not work properly, we had to try during 2 hours to be able to check in. We both got different seat maps to choose from, so we could not sit together. Finally, we got checked-in and could not change anything any more. We contacted customer service, and they told they can also not do anything for us. They can not change seats apparently, and they can also not cancel our check-in so that we can try again. All this are just common request to airlines, this should not be a problem. We payed very high prices for the tickets, and got no service at all. Planes are just low-cost cramped seats as well. So to summarize: high prices, no service and uncomfortable seats with little legroom. Avoid.",Negative

After these fees, plus a wire transfer fee, my compensation was tiny: it did not fully cover my extra nights hotel and phone bill for a cancelled Eurowings flight.

Nearly all of the deals are overseas/international, and even with discounted airfare I can only do that maybe once a year.  Many of them are also for non-English-speaking places--great if you have the time to study up or the money to hire a guide, but not useful for this monolingual early-career professional.  I don't live in a hub city, in terms of flights, so most of the deal emails I receive are out of a hub city 6 hours' drive away.  I would never drive that far for a flight unless the discount was astounding, e.g. $500 off, and it hasn't been.  My #1 wish is that they would implement a way for a user to request deal alerts for specific destinations - for example, the world may not be excited about Kansas City, but if you have family there, you want to know about cheap flights.  I've kept the subscription so far because it pays for itself in one flight, and because I wanted to learn what destinations go on sale often, to plan future adventures.",Negative

9153,"Absolutely INCREDIBLE chartering company!! Quite honestly, it would be difficult for anyone else to match. Worked with Michael on a urgent family trip to Canada and the arrangements and communication were EXCEPTIONAL. A Pilatus PC-12 was arranged and the plane was pitch perfect as was Ryan as a pilot. We had to switch dates less than 24 hours and it was accommodated without hesitation! This is anyones answer looking at chartering a plane...period!",Postive
9154,"From the minute I reached out to Monarch Air, not knowing who they are, I received a 100%comfortability factor. The flight was much less than others, so I was worried, but  not for long.  Christian always responded to my questions and provided information in more than a timely fashion. We booked a charter from Sicily to Naples and we’re afraid the pilot standards would not be the same as US. The weather turned bad in Sicily and I emailed Christian with the potential results of flying through this weather. He was up all night, didn’t miss a beat and let us know the pilots were on their way from Germany to pick us up. Our flight was delayed for an hour so that the wind would die down. Once meeting our captain, Thomas, who has over 2000 hours in this plane, we were comfortable to take off. The best of the best.  Thomas, as it turns out, owns the plane and others in Europe.  He’s phenomenal. I won’t hesitate next time. We look forward to working with all of Monarch’s partners again. Christian made this flight happen and again, he’s the best of the best.  Can’t wait to work with Christian stateside!   🦋",Postive

I appreciated having a single point of contact throughout the process, Chris was always there for me. I moved with 9 cats - Chris helped me to pick the right aircraft to fit the cat carriers, ground transportation to make it door-to-door, all details sorted out. The pilots were amazing, they made everything they could to make us feel comfortable, minimize the stress for the cats and provide us a great experience. I could not be happier!",Postive
9159,Cant say enough about how great my experience was working with Michael and the Monarch team. We chartered international for the first time and Michael not only had the best pricing but made sure we had all the proper paper work/documents needed to fly from NY to London. I have been chartering for over 10 years and this was by far the most professional and smooth trip i have ever had. Cant thank you enough Michael :),Postive
9160,Monarch Air Group made my bachelorette party to Nashville a dream come true! Taylor was so helpful in arranging everything we could ever need from catering and transport to and from the airport. She was highly professional and allowed us to choose from a few different planes while providing insight for each option which ultimately helped us select the best plane for the trip! The communication level was top notch throughout the entire process and she made sure everything went as smoothly as possible. I will definitely be booking all my trips with Monarch Air! Thank you Taylor!!!,Postive
9161,Working with Michael at Monarch was a pleasure! Me and my friends decided to take a last minute trip to Napa Valley and indulge in some of our favorite wines. Michael was able to find us an aircraft on short notice and guided us every step of the way through the process. He even arranged to have a car take us from vineyard to vineyard and back to our plane later that night. Can’t wait to fly again with Monarch!,Postive

9175,"We booked our flight from LA to Manila roundtrip via Mango Tours with PAL as our chosen airline. When the Philippine president announced a flight ban that will begin within 72 hours, we called PAL and Mango tours right away to get our flights changed. Because we booked via Mango Tours, PAL was unable to help us change our flights. After waiting for more than 1 hour, Mango tours answered our call via telephone. They were glad to assist us and promised that they forwarded our concern to the right department and that someone from that department will contact us. We even confirmed the phone number and email to be used to communicate. We waited for 12 hours, but we did not receive an email or phone call. I tried to email someone, but we did not receive any response. We understand that they are experiencing a maximum amount of emails and telephone calls because many of their customers are affected by this travel ban, but what we do not understand is that we already reached them and they know our concern, but nobody tried to reach out to us again like they promised. Because we cannot rely on them to help us, we booked a one way flight to LA with 3 layovers. Like everyone, this is the most stressful trip we had. If we waited for their response, we would not be able to come back to LA in a timely manner in accordance to the ban. If I did not email their customer service again, nobody would reach out to us five days later. All we want is for them to respond to us in a timely manner, as fast as we provide payment based on their timeline as well. What made us more disappointed with this business is, after we explained our circumstance of buying a new flight ticket back to LA, they continued to ask us what our new preferred flight date is. We feel disrespected and ignored because it seems like they did not even find time to read our email and understand our situation. And, even after explaining the same thing to them again, they offered to rebook the flight until 06/05/2020, without considering AGAIN that the person is now back to LA and that no one will be able to use that ticket during the timeline that they provided. The least that they can do is LISTEN, UNDERSTAND and RESPOND appropriately to the concerns of their customers, but, apparently, that is lost in the middle of this chaos.",Negative

9178,"Mango Tours is a complete scam and criminal in refusing to help. With the travel restrictions in the Philppines under Enhanced Community Quarantine stating inbound flights will only be for repatriating Filipinos (which I and my family are not) they are still refusing to offer me a refund and they DARE charge $350 to try and rebook. Their excuse is that they are following PAL guidelines when other family members who booked the SAME EXACT FLIGHT through other agencies are receiving full refunds. Don't give me that made up lie that there's nothing you can do. You are choosing not to help by avoiding calls, hanging up, and refusing to respond. There are travel restrictions by both Philippine and US governments and cities are MANDATING quarantines and you still ignore all this and refuse to help. This is a pandemic. A time of global crisis and they are being uncooperative and unhelpful. Hanging up on me and refusing service. My family members have underlying health conditions that can be deadly for them if they catch COVID19 and they still refuse to offer any refunds or help. You are putting the lives of your customers in danger for your own selfish gains. You're a terrible company and group of people.",Negative

On the return trip however, it was very cold and having just arrived from Florida, we were not dressed for the cold and there was quite a long wait for the shuttle and it was packed with people (no seats) when it did arrive.

I called the main number and the “MANAGER KIARA” was so UNPROFESSIONAL, RUDE, and stated it was not her fault the shuttle could not wait an extra 5 mins after calling us for pick up.  after asking several questions she proceeded to YELL at Me, and Would not let me finish my sentences. The WORSE customer Service I have ever Dealt with in My Entire Life!!!!! That Person needs to get fired!!! I asked for her supervisor and made it seem nobody else was there to talk to But her! Ridiculous!! The wait time did not make sense to me given I have a newborn and it was a very cold morning. We waited another 45 mins until pick up. At pickup the DRIVER did not say one word to us, did not greet us, said nothing ! At Arrival to our car - My Car was filthy full of MUD everywhere - Disgusting!!! I have to power wash my car to get the filth out!! This has been the WORSE place overall and I Travel ALOT! Worse Customer Service, Very Sketchy and Very Unprofessional!!

Three months later our trip commenced and with still the tiniest bit of doubt whether this would actually all fall in to place (you know - if it sounds to good to be true, it usually is!)  we arrived at the airport having pre-booked our seats and our meals. WELL! The whole experience from check-in to landing was amazing! No glitches or mishaps all the way there and all the way home!

My first complaint is that he did not know the baggage allowances provided by the airline. I landed up spending close to US$150 on extra baggage fees. I had a very expensive ticket due to my last minute travel plans and the extra money spent was very upsetting. My other complaint is that I was unable to get any of the meal requests during the flight. Even though I had very long layovers in between my journey, the airline was unable to provide me with my specified meals.

9367,"I took a return flight originating from Thessaloniki, Greece, to LAX  via Turkish Airlines (TA) Istanbul, on 26/11 Nov, 2019. I was notified that my return flight from Istanbul to Greece on 12/01/2020 had been canceled. As TA in Athens do not answer their phones, I personally went to their offices. I was given a new ticket for 13 Jan and told I would be put up in a hotel for the night and fly out the next day, the 13th with NO additional charge for anything to me.  Upon my return to Turkey, 12/01/2020, after 2 days of travel, I could not find anyone to direct me to the hotel desk, as I was told by TA Athens. After asking several agents, and showing the paper from TA, 40 minutes later I was told I need a Turkish visa, where I was charged 35 USD and told I would be reimbursed by TA. Once I passed through all the hurdles, I showed my paper given to me from the Athens TA office and was taken by an airport rep to the hotel desk. At that point, I was asked for my credit card. I questioned it as I was told I would be put up for the night at the expense of TA. He assured me that the charge, done under Azade Turizm ve Gida Ticaistanbul, would only be for the transport and that I would be reimbursed by TA. By now, I was so exhausted and as I had always favored and recommended TA to others, I trusted that all was OK. It took 45 minutes to get to the hotel through winding, dark, narrow roads, in the middle of nowhere, which made for a very uncomfortable ride as I was the only passenger. I still cannot understand why if an entire flight was canceled, I was the only passenger. When we finally arrived at the Karam hotel, which seemed abandoned, other than a stray dog that welcomed me outside and another one inside. I was soon to learn why, as the hotel was not fit even for dogs. Somebody finally came out. I gave him the paper I was given from the Athens TA office. Nobody seemed to understand English, but the driver knew how to ask me for a tip! At this point I just wanted to get to the room, use the restroom, take my shoes off, take a shower and rest. I went to the restroom, lifted the seat and saw dried blood on it! There was a small plastic bottle of shampoo at the sink which I used to clean the toilet. There was no other soap. The shower was grimy and moldy, not fit for humans. The tap looked like it had not been cleaned in months. The furniture and bedspread were full of burn holes. There was no top sheet on the bed. Obviously I got no rest. I just received my credit card bill and saw I was charged 252.86USD by the hotel desk for what was supposed to be a transport charge! Absolutely unacceptable. Even if I had booked that hotel myself, it would only be $35 for one night. I was caught in a very vulnerable state, exhausted and not knowing the exchange value, and ripped off, for lack of a better word, by the clerk at Azade Turizm ve Gida Ticainstanbul hotel desk at the airport! I contacted TA, filed a complaint exactly as I have written above, sent all the documentation and expected an investigation and full compensation. Instead, I got a reply saying that I had been notified of the cancellation in advance and there was nothing they could do, with absolutely NO mention of my actual complaint regarding the charges. Contrary to my prior impressions and the so many negative comments here, Turkish Airlines is a company that does not take responsibility for their wrong doing and does not strive for excellent customer service or at least even take it seriously. The hotel desk at the airport,  that charged me 252.86 USD for what they claimed was only for transport to the hotel and that I would get reimbursed by TA, defrauded me by charging me an outrageous amount. COMPLETELY INCOMPETENT CUSTOMER SERVICE both by TA and the hotel desk at the airport, let alone a dog house claiming to be a hotel. This was by far the worst experience with an airline that I've ever been subjected to, and I have traveled extensively around the world. Beware!",Negative

9374,"Please please please, DO NOT fly with Turkish Airlines. Me and my family had a holiday planned in late October and early November, to Turkey and then Iran (my home country). The plan was to fly from Birmingham to Istanbul, stay in Turkey for 5 days and then travel to Iran. 2 weeks, before our flight, the issue between Turkey and Syria happened (Turkish militants attacked Syrian Kurds) and the British Government strongly recommended not to travel to Turkey, especially the southern part. I called the airline (Turkish Airlines) to change our ticket due to unexpected circumstances. They said as our ticket does not include free change or cancellation, I have to pay £1300 to change just one part of my ticket. I explained the situation, but they said the airport is safe (I didn’t want to stay in airport for 5 days). Finally, they suggested that I buy a one-way ticket, same day of my arrival to Istanbul. I paid £600 and bought the ticket from Istanbul to Tehran (as they suggested). We travelled to Iran and had a transit via Istanbul. However, when we went to the airport to came back to Birmingham, they said because we didn’t use one part of our ticket (as they had suggested over the phone when I called them two weeks before my flight), they had cancelled our return ticket!!!!!! Imagine, making a 2 hour trip to the airport, and now you have made it to the airport with a 1 year old, ready to check in your luggage, baby is unsettled because it is 1 am and doesn’t know what’s going on, and they say you don’t have a ticket… YOUR TICKET HAS BEEN CANCELLED!! I had to pay another £1200 to purchase another one-way ticket Lufthansa. So, we had a 2 hour drive back from the airport and returned the next day to finally fly back to the UK. NOT FUN AT ALL. Turkish Airlines shame on you!!! At least you could have emailed us to say you had cancelled out ticket. One year old, this wasn’t fair on him!!! I spoke with some solicitors about the situation and they told me as my destination is out of EU, also the head office of the Turkish Airlineshairlines is out of EU too, I can’t request for any compensation!!! If you want to travel to any country out of EU, NEVER EVER use Turkish Airlines. You won’t get any thing for any sort of delay or cancellation. Not worth to risk it. Even if you want to travel to Turkey, use a connection flight. Even swim if necessary but stay away from Turkish Airline. If you made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read this.

I was disgracefully treated by the staff to go back to my seat and leave the child alone. I was scared, nervous and crying but the staff did not listen to me. The other passengers also requested to give us seats together but staff did not listen. During all this time the staff was only communicating in Turkish, i told them again and again but they were not able to communicate in English which was very frustrating. During take off my child was crying for me but i was not allowed to go to her. After take off the staff came and said we have 2 seats at the back, which i was requesting before take off. They lied and was highly unpolite, unhuman and uncultured unlike Turkish people.

The food on the plane was vile, the staff were unhelpful, the cleanliness of the plane was disgusting, the roughest landing I have ever experienced, people on the plane were screaming some were praying and most were crying and even the staff were shaken up, poor communication and the handling of my luggage left my suitcases broken. For the price you pay and the opulent image that Turkish Airlines portray is all not worth it.

9406,"I booked a trip on the 25th of July, for the 1st of August. The next day, I received an email from kiwi saying one of the flights was canceled. I was requested to do a paid alternative for 173€, which put my total for the flights in 883€. This was advised by their customer support team on the phone. The next day, I received another email saying that one of the flights for which I paid 173€ was changed, and it would depart 24h later, making me miss all the connecting flights. I spoke to the airport where I would be stranded if I took that flight that would depart and arrive 24 later, and they said I would not be able to leave the airport or stay ther elonger than 24h. That same day, I spoke with kiwi.com and asked them to quote me the prices for all flights after the one that had been delayed for 24h, and move them 1 day later. Quoted price, on the phone, was 201.33€. I asked to be sent the proposal by email asap, as this was discussed in the morning, and I would accept the changes. They told me I was going to be called by a supervisor, which didn't happen. That day, but at 11pm, I received an email that had me fly on the 1st (in that same flight that had originally been delayed 24h), and do a transfer of 34h at an airport where we are not allowed to leave. This is opposed to what I was quoted on the phone, that I would do a 1 day layover in a city where I would be able to leave the airport. I spoke again with the customer support team, and was told I was going to be contacted by a supervisor within 24h. It didn't happen. So today I called again the customer support team, and explained that one of the flights they had proposed wasn't happening as the airline delayed it for 24h, and to make the correction so that I would be able to make the booking. I was told I was going to be contacted by a supervisor. It didn't happen. After calling them again, and pushing my way through a supervisor, I was told the following: 1) The trip of 68h that we sent you by email 50 minutes ago (3 times they sent the trip): you can pay the 201€ extra, and we know that one of the flights will be delayed for 24h, although our system isn't shwowing it. So you will arrive at an airport 24h later, lose the connecting flights, but even though you booked with kiwi.com guarantee, it won't be under the guarantee that we will pay for your expenses in case of delay, flight changes, or cancellations. 2) Alternatively, you can go to that same airport, but do a different flight. You will be asked to pay an extra 624€ (on top of those 883€), and you will wait for a connecting flight for 54h (although the airport says we are not permitted to stay at the airport for longer than 48h, or leave the airport). 3) You can also pay 970€ more, and do a different flight altogether. So I would pay to kiwi.com 1 853€ to not have any support, although their terms and conditions say that all bookings are made with their guarantee. They will also quote their Force Majeure clause in the terms & Conditions of the guarantee, although it has no mention of travel disruptions caused by a health situation, pandemic, or reduced flight options as a consequence of low flux of people. Oh, and not to mention that the subject line of one of the emails I received, with proposed changes, had nothing to do with my booking number, and it caused arguments with 3 customer support agents? So, basically, kiwi.com: 1) Suggests changes that come to shoot you in the foot (of course always paid changes) 2) If you tell them something is wrong and ask them to make a small correction and you will pay the difference, they won't do it 3) When they say you will be contacted by a supervisor, 3 out of 4 times they are lying 4) They do not take your phone number even after assuring you they did 5) They won't call the airlines to confirm that you are right, and a flight was indeed delayed for 24h 6) Will propose a speedy compensation process, that would last 6 weeks. For my 883€ expenses, the quoted price was 1.000€. So the math doesn't really add up 7) After 4 days of calls where you explain to them there is an error, and they agree there is, and you ask them to fix it and you will pay, and they refuse to fix it. Where you ask to be contacted by a supervisor, and you aren't, they come with the awesome alternative of staying at an airport for 54h when the maximum allowed is 48h, or pay almost 1.000€ for a new flight. Oh, and you can only ask for a refund on the other flights of the trip after you arrive to the destination. So after the flights happened. So after the airlines noted you as a no-showing passenger...

9408,"I booked two tickets with Kiwi.com for $1,544 ( booking number:103425091 ) for the flights that were supposed to take place on March 6, 2020. On March 3, 2020, Kiwi.com sent me an email informing me that our itinerary was affected by the  Air Traffic Controllers strike in France, from March 4 to March 9, 2020 and to expect cancellations of all flights originating from or traveling to France. After I received the email from Kiwi.com, the same day, on March 3, 2020, as Kiwi.com recommended in that email, I called the airlines directly, the Norwegian Airlines and the Wizzair Airlines for an alternative solution for the affected flights by the strike action in France, the flights to and from France.  I took notes during all conversations, and all conversations were recorded by Kiwi.com and these airline companies, as I was inforrmed. I spoke with Olga (located in Ukraine) and respectively, Shidar Humar (located in India) and they both stated that they don't provide an alternative solution, and that it is Kiwi.com's responsibility to provide us with an alternative solution or the refund. As Kiwi.com also recommended in that email, I checked the status of our flight 48 hours beforehand, by calling  Kiwi.com on the morning of March 4, 2020 and spoke with Siddhint (located in India) and his supervisor Vernon (located in India) and both confirmed that those 2 flights scheduled for March 6 and 7- to and from France- have been cancelled, and they said that Kiwi.com doesn't provide an alternative solution, therefore I had to cancel the whole trip. Supervisor Vernon apologized for this situation, and he acknowledged that this is not a voluntary cancelation on our behalf and he said that he understands  why I canceled the whole trip and I asked for a full refund for the two tickets. He said that he will call me back that afternoon, but he didn't call me back. On March 5, 2020, I called Kiwi.com again and spoke with Laine (located in Philippines), who also confirmed that those 2 flights were canceled. I explained to her the whole situation again, and asked her to connect me with supervisor Vernon. She said that Vernon was not available at that time, and that she left him a message to call me back, but he never called me back. Because of all these problems I contacted my bank and opened a dispute, but Kiwi.com responded with false information to my bank, not mentioning anything about these flights cancelations. This is fraud!!! Ever since then I have been contacting Kiwi.com so many times by phone and email. It's very frustrating to have to deal with a dishonest company, such as Kiwi.com. The airline companies already refunded the money to Kiwi.com for the canceled flights, but Kiwi.com refuses to refund the money to their customers. This is totally wrong, this is fraud!!! Kiwicom makes false promises about the guaranteed refund. They have horrible customer service! All customers who have been defrauded by Kiwi.com should take legal action!!!

9439,"I would not recommend Kiwi.com to anyone. These are difficult times for the Aviation industry, and I understand refund processes will be slower, however what I cannot accept is the fact Kiwi.com do not directly book with the airlines. Having middlemen in the booking process puts you, the passenger, at a indeterminable financial risk. As far as I am concerned I paid Kiwi to book with the airlines and would expect any refund to come from one of those two sources, not to have to pass through an intermediary. I have detailed my experience below, I'm sure Kiwi is great when everything goes smoothly, but it is a nightmare when it doesn't. I had booked a once in a lifetime holiday to Japan pre COVID for April, once the pandemic hit in east asia I phoned up to enquire about potentially cancelling the flights in advance (my view was it would be easier than when the inevitable happened and the flights where cancelled). I was offered a £10 refund for almost £1000 of flights! I didn't take this and edged my bets. The flights where then, obviously, all cancelled so I phoned up multiple times, eventually getting through after a few weeks, and was told to apply for a refund. The options involved either paying for an expedited service or waiting for a 3 month refund, I took the longer free service. 3 months passed and no news came in, so I phoned again and was told there had been a delay with the airlines. I waited a further 4 weeks and phoned again to find that my booking had still not been refunded (4 months since the initial request). Kiwi.com where also unable to  estimate when the refund would come in, the phone operator laughed when I asked if it would take years - but at this rate it wouldn't be surprising. I was informed that there was nothing that could be done, I could not now expedite my request and am in the hands of an apparent '3rd party' booking company. I  find it fascinating that kiwi.com do not, in fact, book directly with the airlines but rather have an additional company between themselves and the ticketing office - surprising for a company acting as a middle-man to have a middle-man. I was informed by the operator that they had got in touch with this company a few weeks beforehand and had not heard back. It is important to note that the flights where with 4 different major airlines who have been fairly efficient at providing refunds in recent months, to the best of my knowledge, so the problem does not lie there. I am now in the position that I will be having to attempt to raise a dispute through my credit card agency, but honestly this process has been extremely tiring and needlessly complicated. The lack of guarantee on any refund, inability to keep within set timescales, and use of a 3rd party booking company is scandalous, combine this with poor customer support and ill informed operators and my time with Kiwi has been nothing short of a nightmare.

9454,"I booked a flight for March 10th to Amsterdam and return.  I received a very good price for the flight.  Then the Corona virus struck. All my hotels and other flights were being shut down so I needed to cancel my flight. My flight that I booked with Exploretrip was going to be with United Airlines, Minneapolis to Amsterdam and return.  Because of the virus, United Airlines agreed to refund or reschedule all tickets.  When I tried to get a refund with United, they declined because I didn't book directly with United.  They said I needed to contact Exploretrip. Exploretrip refused to give me a refund because the ticket was nonrefundable. I explained that United was now allowing flight changes  and refunds, they sent me back to United.  I spent hours on the phone explaining the situation with different representatives and supervisors. It was now March 10th my flight would be leaving in 8 hours, Exploretrip agreed to allow a flight change but I had to pick a date in the future, not knowing how long this virus would last.  They would not refund my money, as United would nor would they give me a voucher to be used in a year as other airlines were doing. So I picked a date in October, hoping at that time the virus situation would be cleared up but not knowing what else would be happening in my life that far ahead.  I booked a new flight but now the ticket price was $300 more than what I paid before.  So do I lose the money I paid before or do I put out more money for a new ticket?  This was absolutely terrible customer service.  At the very least, Exploretrip could have provided a voucher to be used at a later date but that was to difficult for them to do.

I called ExploreTrip and was told that I could not rebook without paying a fare difference. But the would not tell how much, and told me to call China Airlines to rebook. He disconnected me abruptly. Subsequently, I called China Airlines North American hotline. The rep at China Airlines told me that there was no guarantee that my re-booked flight would not be cancelled again because of border closures. She told me to call ExploreTrip back, and get a refund instead. I called many times in the following days but to no avail. Finally after 3 days of no lucky getting hold of a real person, I put in a refund request online. After waiting for another 3 days, I called ExploreTrip for status of the refund. The rep then told me another story. I had to pay $55 USD for penalty or I could rebook without a fare difference. I told him that I was informed by China Airlines that I would get a full refund under the circumstances. He hung up on me.  I am now on hold for an hour to speak to an agent at China Airlines.

In Brussels, the staff was making rounds eyeing passenger’s carry ons and asking them to test the size in the metal case by the gate. Not sure if it is because I had opened the 1” extension on my suitcase, but it wouldn’t fit and the gate employee was inflexible, giving me an additional hard time because I had taken my iPad case out of my tote and called it “a third bag” when I was only allowed two. I argued, barely holding on to my temper: I had just flown Gothenburg to Brussels on the same airline and same type aircraft, my suitcase had fit overhead and my tote under my seat, I could put my iPad back in my tote (or maybe just let me put it in the net of the seat in front of me for heaven’s sake!) but nothing would do. The employee told me: this is Brussels, this is the airline’s base, and here we follow regulations, we are not responsible for how things are regulated in Gothenburg.

9562,"Maybe people purchase pegasus tickets since they are cheaper but actually it’s not worth it, when you have to pay extra for your luggage, meals and seats, it’s not worth it at all, airplanes are miniature with the worst leg room ever, customer service sucks, not professional at all, plus it’s a rip off, i had extra weight of 2kgs and they charged me 51 euros, a total RIPP OFF, don’t get fooled by the cheap tickets, what you lose is way more than what you get.. flight has been delayed 3 times and people are going crazy at the airport!!",Postive
9563,"My husband I were on a flight (PC1163) travelling from Istanbul Sabina Gokcen airport to London Stansted on 18/03/2019, booking number X86C14. A passenger who was seated in 24B got quite drunk and started disturbing others by being very noisy. He was laughing VERY loudly, disturbing the female passenger next to him and being rude and abusive with the flight attendant named Serra. He kept asking for more drinks, and when she came back to say they had no more white wine left, the passenger rudely said ""if you don't have any wine why did you come back then!? Go on and find us some wine"". The flight attendant was very polite and was doing her best. When she went off to find some wine, he lit up a cigarette and started smoking and he suddenly went very quiet, obviously aware of what he's doing isn't allowed. When Serra came back myself and couple of other passengers told her that the guy's been smoking and we could still smell it, the smell lingered for at least twenty minutes. Serra said ""no, really? It can't be.."" she hung around a bit, afraid to turn around and question the passenger, and left. This certainly wasn't the best course of action. Serra should have been assertive and warn the passenger and take whatever legal action necessary. But instead she walked off avoiding confrontation and came back with more and more and more alcohol throughout the flight. She even ignored the guy's sexist sleazy comments. All those announcements we hear on flights must be completely false then? I haven't heard any smoke alarm going..? We were trying to get some sleep as we were up and about all day long. This passenger was not only preventing us from getting some rest, but he was also disturbing other people. It was all so very annoying and frustrating that the cabin crew couldn't care less. I'm pretty sure there are rules about drunken passengers on board and it certainly shouldn't be supported by selling more drinks to the passenger. Please train your staff to do a better job. It's okay to confront passengers. Flight attendants are there for passenger safety, not to be treated as a bartender and an abuse board.",Negative

We were standing in the check in area for an hour while they processed every other passenger to see if there were any empty seats left over.  Finally they let us check in, but only because they still had empty seats after processing every other passenger.

9572,"My wife and I flew from Northern Cyprus, we took off on a 1hr 15min flight to Istanbul, 30 minutes in the captain informed us of fog at Istanbul and he hoped it would clear by the time we got there. Well I kinda hoped that the captain had checked before he took off that he would be able to land. Apparently not! As you guessed, we were unable to land at Istanbul so we were diverted to Ankara 350km in the opposite direction. After zero information and sitting in the plane on the stand at Ankara for 1hr 45mins we took off for Istanbul again this time the airport was open, he’d even checked! Of course on arrival at Istanbul it transpired, not unsurprisingly that we had missed the connection flight to London Stansted. I can only describe what came next as pure chaos. First we were getting the next flight then we weren’t. But actually we were going to a hotel because there was no room on the next flight. After 2 hours of queuing, pushing, shoving and a lot of raised blood pressures we eventually got a voucher for a hotel and told (only by some very helpful English Turkish speaking Cypriots we would be catching the 11.10am flight the next morning. Information, guidance and help from the Pegasus staff was non existent, they are mostly rude, most can’t speak English and if you ask any of them who can they will plead ignorance. Of course we now needed a visa to enter Turkey (not a requirement for Northern Cyprus) £25 each ‘on the door’ x 2 £50 out of pocket, 1 days work lost x 2, plus incidental costs as well. We had no luggage so had to buy a change of clothes each and some toiletries. I estimate Pegasus incompetence to have cost me upwards of £500 in total. On arriving at the hotel it became evident that the bus driver had gone to the wrong hotel 30 mins in the opposite direction to the one we were booked into. Having caught the transfer from our holiday hotel at 3am we finally arrived at the correct hotel in Istanbul (1hr 15 min flight time away remember) at 4.30pm! On arrival back at the airport the next morning we were told after queuing up for over 1hr again by our English, Turkish speaking Cypriots (by this time friends), that the flight we had been re-booked on was full. The next flight was at 20.50 the same evening so we went back to the hotel! We wasted 36hrs with no apology, no empathy, no attempt to organise a replacement flight with another airline, no nothing! We should have arrived back at London Stansted at 11am Sunday, finally got back at 11.15pm Monday. I wrote an email of complaint to the CEO of Pegasus Airlines Mehmet Nane, I advise you not to waste your time. He, or I guess his office passed it to the customer service department who as I had already found out are not fit for purpose they offered a weak apology and 3000 reward points, asking me to get in touch so they could open me a reward points account, yes seriously. So I wrote again to the CEO suggesting he may like to re-consider his companies reply before I left feedback on my experience. This time he ignored me. In summary, this is complete shambles of a company, they have scant regard for their customers and they treat you like animals taking no responsibility for their incompetence or mistakes. Their customer service is the worst ever and reflects their general attitude to their customers.  Never ever again would I contemplate travelling with them and I will actively advise anyone else thinking of doing so. NOT TO!",Negative

It is such a shame because it is a convenient site. I just want to know that my investment is safe...... UPDATE: They took 3 days to get back to us with any sort of answer.  And they are now saying we will not get a refund because we didn’t show up to our flight. We didn’t show up because of the Coronavirus and are advised to not travel to Rome by the government.

None of the telephone numbers on the slip of paper work, the telephone numbers on their website don't work and when you finally, after hours of searching find a number on the internet that actually connected,  you are back to being spoken to like garbage. UNLESS IT IS A LIFE OR DEATH SITUATION I would rather walk than fly with this company. They should be struck off.

9593,"If there was a way to give less than one star I would because of the complete lack of customer service.

At midnight on the day of my flight, I tried at least 10 times, with 2 different phones on both the app and the website only to get a generic error message saying ""sorry we cannot perform this operation at this time"". I waited till the customer service centre was open and after being placed an hold for an hour was told that I had to pay £100 to change the flight. When I queried that and explained that I had already paid for the extra service, I was placed on hold again only to be then told that there was nothing they could simon the phone (even though I called their booking line and they were perfectly happy to help when they initially wanted to charge me £100 to change my flight) and the only way to change it would be to go to the airport. Even then, I was informed, if I get to the airport (which is over 3 hours away) the flight may become fully booked by other people.

But when I tried to check in for the return flight with Ryanair, my reservation couldn't be found. No matter what I did, no reservation found. In a panic, I booked a new one way flight directly from Ryanair. When I showed up to Berlin SXF, the Ryanair agent informed me that the third party booking agency (FlyHacks) used some random email address completely unrelated to my own to reserve the booking. When you check into Ryanair, you are required to submit the email address tied to the reservation in order to find it. So, as a result, I was totally screwed - how could I possible presume any email address was used other than my own for the booking? Not to mention FlyHacks obviously failed to notify me that an email address other than my own was used for the booking. It was clearly a mistake on FlyHacks' side, as the Ryanair agent explained. But there was nothing I could do at that point...so I used the second ticket I bought to get back to Madrid... I am now awaiting a reply to a refund request from FlyHacks and will update this post once the matter is concluded. I am of hope that FlyHacks will do the right thing and compensate me for what was clearly their error.",Negative
9630,I booked a flight with Flyhacks from Tenerife to Copenhagen departure 6 Nov. 2017 using Monarch airline and Norwegian. When Monarch airline got bankrupcy in September I got an e-mail about the bankrupcy from Flyhacks promising news about the situation. I e-mailed them several times asking them about alternative options for the Monarch section of the route but got no answer. I also phoned them but they did not answered the phone. Of course Flyhacks has no responsibility for the bankrupcy of Monarch airline but at least they should inform their costumers about what to do. Until the departure date there was no message at all from Flyhacks. Therefore my advise : never use Flyhacks!,Negative
9631,"I like to warn others using Flyhacks. They appears nice when you book your flight........ after you have paid, they dont care about you at all. Especially be aware using cobinations travels where you have to catch another flight. I experienced that we wasnt able to catch our next flight in Stansted. The connection time were supposed to be 1 hour and 50 min. As the passcontrol took 45 min and the gates closed 30 min before take off we were not able to catch our next flight and had to buy new tickets. I also experienced problems when I had to check in, choose seats in the plain etc. Even Flyhacks actually offered me 100 Euro in discount at my next travel, I´ll never gonna use Flyhacks again. My extra cost were about 800 GBP, as we were 2 adults and 4 kids who needed new tickets from Stansted to Copenhagen.",Negative
9632,"Just like the other reviewers, I had a terrible experience with the website. I booked the tickets for a flight and my credit card was charged at the time. 3 days later (!!!) I received an email telling me I need to pay 15 euro extra if I want to keep the tickets I bought. When I called customer services they told me that the tickets hadn't been bought at the time I made the purchase and the price had since gone up. When I asked why I should be the one to bear the difference in price that happened because they didn't process the payment at the time that it was made I was told that ""the low-cost market is volatile"", which wasn't actually my problem at all, since they should have bought the ticket at the time I made the online purchase. Apparently the issue was that I payed with my girlfriend's credit card and not my own, and they weren't sure whether the payment was ok -  they thought maybe the card was stolen and it took them three days to confirm. All of this because their website is not enrolled in a 3D Secure system - probably because they are too cheap to do it.",Negative

When my booking had gone through I was directed to a page that informed me, that the website of the airline company was currently unavailable, but they would book my tickets as soon as possible. I immediately tested the airline site and it worked fine. After 30 minutes I received a mail from Flyhacks informing me, that I needed to pay for my tickets - which I had already done in the booking process - the price was now 700 DKK more (about 100€). I was not informed why the price had changed, only that I should hurry and pay before the price would go further up. I called their help desk and told them I didn't understand the mail I'd received. I was told that the tickets I had bought, was not available and the price had changed. I asked why they sold tickets at a price, when that same price obviously wasn't correct. They replied that I would have to ask the airline that question. I asked to get my ticket cancelled, which they did. Companies like this is the reason I get anxious paying for services online.

Additionally, I was told at the airport that I had been sold a round trip ticket instead of one-way as I had booked. At no point was I informed about that, nor receive a ticket.

9650,"Disaster!!! I booked a multi city itinerary with Sky-Tours. When I showed up at the airport, My reservation had the wrong last name, even though my receipt showed the passenger name spelled correctly. Lufthansa said Sky-tours had to fix it and Sky-tours said Lufthansa should fix it. Needless to say, in the 2 1/2 hours prior to the flight, neither could fix it and I was denied boarding on that ticket. I had to buy a last minute ticket to make it to the start of our tour and my wife and I had to split up in Frankfurt and go separately to Egypt. Our second leg of the trip to Greece was uneventful. Somehow the my name was correct on the second leg, but not on the first. This is hard to understand since I made the entire reservation in one transaction. Now on the return flight, since I had been denied boarding on the first flight, Lufthansa cancelled my return leg. I started contacting Sky-Tours 4 days prior to the return flight about this and they finally got me a reservation home about 36 hours prior to departure. They say they are available 24/7. By phone, that is not true. I called them several times from Greece during normal business hours (9-5 EST) and after 5-10min on hold, I was hung up on. Online chat was marginally better. I was connected 1 of the 2 times I tried. Email, I always received a response, Usually within 24hrs. What I am trying to say, if you need short notice help, you will probably be disappointed. After weekly contacts with Sky-Tours, I am still waiting for a refund of the flights I was denied boarding. From my experience, my recommendation would be to spend a little more money and use a different booking site.",Negative

I forwarded alle papers (tickets, damage report, photos, boarding pass and luggage receipt and also receipt for the new suitcase bought in Sidney). It was extremely difficult to get in touch with anyone in their office. When calling, an answering machine kept telling about opening hours, but no-one ever answered the phone. I mailed several times, and then someone replied, but only to tell me that if I was lucky, they would refund half of what I had been paying for the suitcase. I did not ask the staff to drop my suitcase in order to ruin it completely, but the Airline company is making it extremely difficult to refund my expenses. The flight itself was fine. We had made an upgrade and everything was fine,  but service upon return was just awful, and I have still not got my money back.

I needed this flight booked as soon as possible, I have been messed around, I cannot believe after seeing all these terrible reviews that this company is still in business, and I really hope Skyscanner take them off of there website.

9658,This will be a long comprehensive yet fully justified review as I feel that the true reflection and reputation of Singapore Airlines needs to be corrected here particularly since their seems to be a whole bunch of liars or moaners on here that for some reason are only reviewing to cause trouble with their ridiculous phoney gripes. Travelled out with my family from LHR on a 777-300er in economy which was incredibly enjoyable all the way. Literally managed to sleep like a baby as the seats were so comfortable the leg room brilliant with firm footrests the recline was like that of premium on most other airlines and the width at 19” is as good as you will find in the industry anywhere due to the generous 3-3-3 config where as most other airlines operating 777’s will squeeze in an extra seat to make a 3-4-3 configuration (try emirates for example!).Excellent choice of food (with metal cutlery) and an incredible range of alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages (even a superb Singapore sling available) help yourself-to snacks of various kinds in the galleys whenever you want them. The cabin crew were as always so professional friendly efficient and helpful with nothing being too much effort. IFE is superb with a great range of movies and all manner of entertainment both new recent and old and a touch screen monitor which was huge by economy standards that also had a separate touch screen remote!They also have excellent quality in ear headphones for you to keep! Blankets pillows eye shades socks combs tooth paste/brush razors shave cream and various other amenities all provided. Toilets are spotless as was the cabin and it’s lovely calming ambience and gentle mood lighting. Then onward on a 3 week old 787-10 Dreamliner journey to Bali/a 1 year old A350 from Jakarta - Singapore and finally a brand new one month old A380 back to London with its equally and superb new cabin design.Again all these other sectors were also absolutely fantastic in every way and replicated the initial outbound journey form LHR. Singapore Airlines fleet is incredibly new when compared to many other airlines with so many new aircraft both in operation and on order.They seem to just keep on getting better and better all the time and never get complacent or rest on their laurels for a moment. Service levels are top notch both in the air and on the ground. CS team are always spot on and will do everything they can to help and assist within there means. I really cannot fault them it’s both effortless and a pleasure to deal with them. This airline has never once in my 25 years of flying with them disappointed or let me down in any way and you will not find a better airline in the skies today hence their number 1 status from Skytrax and TA amongst others. Some of the comments on here are utterly preposterous laughable and I suspect either made up (I believe in some cases its obvious why) or simply inaccurate for example one of the comments below from someone claiming that they think they should simply be able to sell their ticket to anyone is just unbelievably ridiculous as if any airline would allow that ! I just don’t buy any of these ridiculous comments as after years and years and countless flights with them that are so consistently great it’s just not how they operate in any way at all and highly unusual for them to be anything other than at least on par. You would really have to be one of life’s real miserable grumblers to have a major moan at SIA.Its interesting to note how reviews on other websites are significantly much better than on here where many people just seem to get a kick out of moaning (don’t we know all about that of late!) but certainly SQ don’t deserve most if any of the negativity they have received on here. I highly recommend anyone to fly with this airline you won’t be disappointed unless you are a moaner and you will have a fantastic time on board. Looking forward to our next trip very soon and thank you Singapore Airlines!,Postive
9659,"After traveling to Australia, New Zealand and Singapore over the Christmas period. We have six flights on a block booking. Three flights where with Singapore Airlines. On each flight we felt that the cabin crew did not really have any interest in looking after us. The first flight from London to Singapore we were told that they had run out of the choice of dishes and had only one dish. After I challenged this the crew member suddenly came up with another choice. The second flight from Singapore to Sydney had a lack of refreshments served and the toilets were in a very dirty state from the start of the flight. The third flight from Singapore to London we were kept in night mode for whole 14hr flight with the exception of two meal servings. This was a 9am take off so ther was no need to keep us in the controlled state. When asking for a refill of coffee during the mail I was met with an attitude that I had inconvenienced the crew member let alone having th ask for milk and sugar. Keeping a cabin in night mode gave my the impression that the the crew wanted to keep our class in its place. It was also noticeable the lack of crew that where available in our section. Three other flights were with New Zealand air a Virgin Australia, the service on these flight were spot on. We will not be booking with Singapore Airline again.",Negative
9660,"Our flight from Phnom Penh was delayed so we did not make our connecting flight in Singapore. While Singapore Airlines did put us on a later flight, it meant an eight hour wait in Singapore airport and another stopover in London, instead of a direct flight to Copenhagen. We Finally arrived in Copenhagen 14 hours later that scheduled. Back home I contacted Customer service and after 21 days (!) they answered, refusing to give me any compensation. When i complained again they offered me a voucher for SDG 100. I paid over SDG 3000 for business class tickets because it was important for me to arrive on schedule and well rested, ready to work. Instead I arrived extremely late and exhausted from the very long travel time. In this regard SDG 100 is by no means a fair compensation. I can only say that this airline is not worth your money, with this kind of customer service",Negative
9661,"Spent the extra to go Premium Economy. While the flight to Paris from Brisbane was relatively enjoyable, the return was not. The woman serving our aisle constantly forgot things. I was given half a meal (no diet restrictions) she just forgot to give the rest. When I realised because the woman across from me received her full meal (from the FA on the other aisle). I asked my FA for the rest. She said she would have to check if she had any left. She then proceeded to serve the rest of her side of the plane and then forgot entirely. When I pressed the service button, she came up and told me I had bumped it before even asking if I needed anything. I reminded her about the meal but she said they had all gone. I ended up with an economy meal then - no choice. My partner numerous times requested a drink and had to remind the woman 15 minutes later when nothing came. Then to top it off - For Christmas my partner purchased a new suitcase for me. So the return trip was its first time. It was a Samsonite Case and it arrived in Brisbane completely trashed. Plastic parts around the handle snapped off, dents so large it pierced the plastic the whole way through. My zip doesnt even zip up flush to the case any longer. ONE FLIGHT!

9666,"When the airline industry has limited regulations, we need to start asking ourselves what is the outcome of that? Singapore Airlines was once a glowing, reputable airline, now it has become so disingenuous to its core customer base that it's lost touch and put the almighty dollar above what gives it business in the first place. With a refund policy that promotes unhealthy virtues of greed, Singapore Airline needs to be blacklisted. If you have more than 2 months to on-sell a ticket, and IF you can ""possibly"" give a refund, it means that you can actually do so. You are turning over twice the profit on your product by leaving your clients penniless and frustrated. Would you rather go back to what you once stood for and receive glowing reviews? Or do you prefer to have the backlash of angered clients who have been given the worst treatment by your airline?",Negative

9669,This is a terribly managed travel company. Their online information is incorrect and deceiving. I doubt it is intentionally deceiving but it is severe incompetence at best. The website consistently shows flights that are not available. They make you go through the entire booking process including payment and then you may find out the flight is not available. In my case I did not even get notification that there was no booking made after I tried to pay. I had to check with my credit card company to see that no payment had gone through and that therefore no booking was confirmed. When I called Ctrip they simply said that the flight was not available at the price they advertised and hence the booking could not be processed. No other travel companies work on this basis. The flights you see advertised can actually be booked at the price advertised. Not so with Ctrip.This happened to me on 3 separate occasions. Completely unreliable and untrustworthy.,Negative
9670,"BAD EXPERIENCE! UNREASONABLE SYSTEM! I booked Royal Bangkok Hotel for 3 nights for my client as i was enticed by their lowest price and ""INSTANT CONFIRMATION"" words which i found out that its not really instant. I booked at night, charged my debit card right away but i did not received any confirmation by email except a call from china the next morning only and informed me that they could not confirm my booking as hotel is fully booked. Then when i asked for refund, i was informed that it would take 7 days. Fine. But worst was when i received email from them informing me that my booking was cancelled as per my request and it would take one month for them to reverse the money to my card. Though i insisted that one month is too long as i need that money to book the same hotel through other agents before the check-in which is just few days from now. But still they insisted its one month. I was working in travel agency for many years and this is the very 1st time i faced this kind of problem, I have booked hundreds of hotels, tours, and flights for my clients through other suppliers and have never faced problem like this. In case Ctrip management read this review, please do the necessary action. My client is checking in on 2/11/17 so i have to taken out my own money to pay for the hotel.

Instead I had to contact them for my money to be refunded, then advised that it had been, it was the banks fault, and then it would take two weeks.

Book with them and pray to god you have a room? lol Unacceptable. Even if I do have a room, to not be able to confirm it is crazy. I wouldn't use this again. Agoda or the other bigger sites are a bit more expensive but at least you can confirm you have a room. Don't be suckered in by the cheaper rates. Honestly this hassle is not worth it. Just pay the extra 5 bucks a night on agoda and confirm you have a room. UPDATED: Ctrip immediately contacted me after this review and looked over my issue and it was resolved in hours. I still don't like the uncertainty of not having a confirmation from the hotel BUT, seeing that Ctrip had the last remaining room I wanted from the hotel, I think overall it was worth it. Thank you for addressing this issue quickly. However the hassle is something I am still weary of experiencing, especially when I NEED a room. Buyer beware.",Postive
9681,"I mostly had a positive experience flying from London to Vietnam via Singapore. We travelled on an A380 to Singapore. We found the seats quite uncomfortable yet the seats on the aging A320 that took us to Da Nang were much more comfortable. Food on the A380 was amazing. I've never tasted airline food this good. The curry on the way out was absolutely fantastic!!! The cabin crew were very efficient and helpful. My main gripe is that because we found the seats uncomfortable on the A380, I changed my seats for the return journey to 'extra legroom'. This placed us next to the toilets which would have been fine apart from the constant queue for the toilet and people doing their exercises in the space in front of us classed as 'extra legroom'. Twice people stomped on my feet when I was trying to sleep when the lights were dimmed. So, the extra £118 I paid for these seats was pretty much a waste of time. Apart from this, it was a positive experience.",Postive
9682,"I would have given them no stars, if at all possible. This is the worst airline out there, happy to take your money for a ticket, but if you want to change the flight even though its over 6 months away, they were going to charge me £600. Then, I asked to cancel it, well you can cancel it, but no refund, even though its six months away. Then I asked if I could sell it to someone else? No, all flights are non transferable. There is no give with this company, no one to complain to and no one in the UK to help with this. This is the worst company I have ever had to deal with and how they operate within the UK through middle me is unbelievable as they surely breach our trading standards laws and multiple EU laws to boot. Suffice to say, I will never use them again!",Negative
9683,"Terrible experience. I booked a window seat but they put me just in the middle which it is completely opposite of what I wanted. I complained on the plane but nobody wanted to help me, then I complained when I landed in London and according to them, I selected a middle seat (the customer service in London was quite rude). Why would I select a middle seat prior to my flight if this is not what I wanted? Anyway, they said in the end that because they are right, there is no way they can help me. 15hours of flight in a seat that you do not want to be at is not the best experience. In general, I would say and after flying with other airlines in economy to Singapore that the service for most of them is pretty much the same. I paid a plus of 350£ for this airline for the good things I heard about them but it is not worth the money. Also, I never had this issue. Hence my struggle to understand why this airline is so good.",Negative
9684,"Best airline experience I've had, even the things that weren't working were turned around to their advantage. Flew from copenhagen to sydney via singapore, economy. Better food than I've experience in flights before. Good in-flight entertainment with great selection of movies, tv shows and games. The lavatories were clean, and even had mouthwash, toothbrushes and skin products. On my way home I had an 18 hour layover in Singapore. Somehow even that was a positive experience. The airport has plenty of seating and power outlets, good food options, free cinema, rest areas and free bus tours of singapore. On the final leg of the trip there was a problem with the entertainment system, however, this was at night and every passenger was given a small gift of chokolade for their inconvenience.",Postive

9689,the bad service ever i had for online hotel booking ! i had made a hotel booking on 19 Oct 2017 and it charged to my credit card on the same day. Then i received an email about my booking was done and i have to activate my account. After that i never get an confirmation of email from Ctrip. So i checked back my Ctrip account and it shows my booking is processing before it becomes confirmed. So i think they will inform me what is the problem before my guest will check in on 26 Oct 2017. But they never inform me any until my guest is there at the reception! I called up Ctrip and the service staff told me that the room type that i booked was not available and she will help me to find another room now or another hotel.. how stupid is that ! And will refund me the payment within 15 days. Means they charged me without any notice that the room is available or not! I swear i will not book with Ctrip anymore..,Negative

9691,"I am disgusted with C-trip and their complete inadequate ability to serve their customers.  I gave them a second chance after a nightmare incident with a trip I took from Japan to Hong Kong.  So this is my second time to file a bad review on this company. I booked another flight with C-trip hoping the first trip I booked was just an over sight after they contacted me for writing a bad review.  That most definitely was a horrible idea and I will be telling every person I know to never use this company. I live on a US Navy base in Japan and I booked a flight from Japan to Korea several weeks in advanced.  Unexpectedly a Typhoon was headed our direction. After receiving notice from the base that everything was being shut down, including all shuttles to the airport, I took a military flight to Korea two days earlier than the flight I had booked with C-trip. The flight I had booked was a round-trip flight.  Before I left, I called C-trip  and C-trip told me if the Typhoon hit our area, flights would be rescheduled.  I told them I was thinking about getting an earlier flight as not to riski not being able to get to Korea on time.  They said I would have to pay a rebooking fee, I also wanted to make sure I would be able to fly back and not lose my returned flight.  I told them not to cancel my flight as I wanted to monitor where the Typhoon was headed. As I mentioned, once the base sent out notices that the base was shutting down, I booked a military flight to Korea.  The Typhoon was a direct hit to Tokyo and as expected, transportation from NAF Atsugi was suspended.  There would have been no way to get to Narita Airport two and half hours away in Atsugi. My flight was not cancelled but transportation to the airport was. There was wide spread flooding and damage to the train stations and until they were deemed safe, routes were suspended. Once, I got settled in Korea, I called the airlines to find out if my flight had been cancelled and I informed them I booked another flight to Korea. They told me the flight was not cancelled. I informed them I still wanted to keep my return flight the same.  The airline company informed me if I missed my flight to Korea I would lose my return flight with no refund.  The airlines told me if I had booked with them instead of a travel agency, they could have made alernate arrangements.  They told me to contact the travel agency. I immediately called C-trip and could not get an English speaking person. I had my Korean friend translate my dilemma and C-trip told him, they couldn't do anything,  I needed to call the airline that C-trip was only a travel agent. He tried to explain the what the airline had told me earlier. Finally he demanded that we spoke to an English speaking person. C-trip said someone would call us back shortly. After three and half hours and no phone call, I called the airline back. While I was talking to the airlines, C-trip finally called me back on my Korean friend's phone. This time in English they kept telling me it was the airline's responsibility not their responsibility. I had the airline on speaker on my phone and they could hear the conversation. So the airline told C-trip they had to make changes. C-trip changed their tune and immediately said they would have someone from management call me back. I thanked the airline and hung up. I told C-trip if I didn't hear back I would be going to the US Navy's Legal department. Two hours later C-trip called back. They still refused to budge and continued to blame the airlines.  I argued to no avail. I demanded to speak to upper management, and upper management asked for proof that transportation was suspended. I emailed them the proof and I never heard back from them. Yesterday someone called and said they were going to give me a partial refund and my returned flight would be cancelled. The refund was only equivalent to $50 USD dollars. I am now stuck in Korea having to book another flight at my expense. The reason for this trip was to meet the USS Reagan as our boats came to port in Korea. I have reached out to other friends who used Expedia, and other travel agencies and NONE of them had issues with rebooking their flights.  I am talking well over a dozen of my friends.  C-trip is the only company who has refused to help their customers. When I get back to Japan, I will be going to base legal directly. In the meantime, I will be sharing this on social media to everyone I know. I will also make sure the military black list C-trip.",Negative

The plane was filthy and made a horrible noise that they jokingly said a Generator was on board to keep the air flow going.",Negative
9736,"I found a mistake on my confirmation emails.  I called to have it fixed.  after 2 1/2 hours, I was told it would cost $400 total to have it corrected (original ticket total was $281)  The company blamed me for the  mistake - it wasn't.

9739,"The  worst airline that I have ever been on. I booked my trip through Expedia. First of all they wanted me to pay for my carry on, it was the correct dimension and it was not over weight, but they only allow you to carry a back pack. Its weird because every other airline lets you have a carry on for free. They wanted to charge me 60 dollars for my carry on. Of course they don’t tell you that before purchasing your ticket.I showed my military ID and told them if they have a discount, usually other airlines have discounts on bags. They told me I was wrong and they don’t accommodate military personnel. I had to go to their website and show them that they do free baggage check for military personnel. When I did this, the lady gave me so much attitude and told me she doesn’t understand why military personnel get so much treatment. Finally after arguing with the lady, I got in the plane just to find out we are going to be delayed because they can’t find the co pilot. My flight from Cancun to Fort Lauderale was Late and I had only 45 min to pick up my bags and go through customs/tsa. I ran through the airport, just as I was getting to the gate, a spirit worker came on the speaker saying we had 5 min. I ran and saw him go into the doors with 3 min left. I nocked on the glass door so he can let me in, but no he just turned around and ignored me. He came back later to tell me he went to close the door and I have to go to customer service. I went to customer service and they told me I won’t be able to get another flight until 6pm the next day. This didn’t work for me because the next day I had a fligh to Barcelona at 530pm. They asked to see my ID and saw I was military, once again I got the worst attitude about being military. They told me they can’t do anything for me and doubt I have a flight to Barcelona. I was willing to show them my confirmation with Expedia but they didn’t want to hear it. The only reason they put me on stand by was because I talked to the supervisor. They didn’t even want to put me on stand by for an earlier flight or give me a hotel for the night. I called Expedia but they couldn’t even agree with spirit or work anything out. I had to buy a brand new ticked with AA for 371 dollars. Expedia refund me 100 for it but it was still 272 plus the hotel I had to pay over night. The whole time I was giving attitude for being military and at one point the counter lady yelled at me. I will never again travel on this airline.",Negative
9740,"Very unpleasant to be my first experience with Spirit. I was traveling on Dec 27 from LAX to MSY in the flight 504. When I checked in at the gate before boarding, there were two ladies checking. One of the ladies checked me and when I walked towards the plane the other one called me with a haughty voice that I was going where I was going. I told him that the other girl had already checked me, then I literally violently pulled the boarding pass from my hands to check on his machine if it was already checked. I demanded her for her rude manner, and she turned around saying bad words that my wife reached to hear because she was in front of her. Once seated on the plane before takeoff, watch as the stewardess closed the upper compartment violently with grocery just because a passenger did not place their luggage properly. The same employee was talking about a lot of bad words during the flight with his partner in the rear area. I took around 30-40 flights per year and this is the 1st time that I see a type of such violent and rude crew and staff of an airline, so I write this review.",Negative

I’ve confirmed that your flight from Detroit (DTW) on April 4th, was delayed one hour and fifty-one minutes   ($$$$$false 4 hours total)   due to Air Traffic Control decisions. ( false we where told weather condition at the desk ) I know this isn’t helpful now, but as much as we strive to operate on schedule, there are times when delays can’t be avoided. I know that this greatly impacted your schedule, and I’m really sorry this happened. While the reality is that delays and cancellations are a very small percentage of our operation( 47 % at spirits ), we appreciate that they are the single greatest cause of frustration for our customers. When a delay exceeds two hours, customers have the options to be booked on our next available flight or cancel for a refund of the affected portion of your itinerary. In this case, I'm glad to see that we didn't have to cancel the flight completely and we got you to your destination safely. In these situations, we don't offer to cover or provide alternate transportation or other compensation or reimbursements. Keep in mind that our Contract of Carriage states, ""Spirit will not assume expenses incurred as a result of a flight delay, cancellation, or schedule change."" It further states, ""Spirit is not responsible or liable for making connections (on its own flights or flights of any other carrier), or for failing to operate any flight according to schedule, or for changing the schedule of any flight."" Again, I'm sorry about this and hope that you will consider flying with us again. We'd love to provide a positive experience in the future.

9747,"My experience can't be new.  I booked a Thanksgiving flight for my daughter in September.  Got a confirmation number, a flight number, all was good.  My daughter got on the site two days before she was to fly and it said CANCELED.  No email stating her seat had been canceled, as a matter of fact, if you go to the Spirit Airlines site and look at the flight there are still seats open.  We called SmartFares to find out what was going on.  WELL...first the representative said an email had been sent out in September, though they could produce no such documentation, and second, and probably most importantly, he said ""Spirit Airlines prices are fluid.  They go up and down all the time.  Your seat was just canceled.""  My husband had the forethought to say, ""Was it canceled by you or because Spirit rejected your proposed price for the seat?""  Spirit had rejected SmartFare's price.  The seat was available for roughly triple the cost.  My daughter would have shown up at the gate and HER confirmation would have been useless, but Spirit would have happily sold her the flight for triple the price at the gate.  So the question that arises is, are SmartFares and Spirit in league with a giant bait and switch scheme?  Feels like it.  We got a Delta flight through Price Line...last minute pricing...but at least she is coming home for the holiday.  Thanks for absolutely nothing SmartFares.  It's interesting you could produce absolutely no documentation regarding cancelation of my documented flight confirmation, but oddly, you could offer me the posted Spirit Airline pricing at the last minute...same flight, same seat...just triple the cost.",Negative

9750,"ABYSMAL experience! Spirit cancelled our flight on the night before our departure without any explanation and they did this precisely two minutes before their customer service closed. Very convenient. We were supposed to depart at 7.25 the next morning, which gives very little time to arrange otherwise. We will now have to either pay for a new one way ticket back or hope that the next available Spirit flight in 24 hours doesn't get cancelled and pay for another night at a hotel.

The only thing they offer to rebook again  for another day or another time today and they don't care that I paid a lot of money for hotel reservation which I'm not able to cancel.

I have NEVER cancelled or rescheduled a flight prior to this incident. I'm tired of corporate greed and avarice practiced by these faceless, soul-less .entities!

9753,"As a sole female traveller I was returning home to England from California;  my journey consisted of 2 flights on a Delta through ticket,  from San Diego to LA with Delta and with Virgin to Manchester.  The half hour flight from San Diego was delayed by over 4 hours causing me to miss my connection in LA.  There was no help whatsoever on the ground in San Diego, upon ringing the helpline, it was a surprise to the call handler that the flight was even delayed.  When this was checked and confirmed I was told I needed to get in touch with Virgin. Attempting to do thus resulted in me using all my call credit and I was forced to Email my travel agent back in England for advice.  They told me that it was Deltas responsibility to rebook my flight from LA to Manchester using a different carrier if necessary and providing hotel accommodation if no flight was available that day. Upon arrival at LA (at around 7pm) I was directed to the Delta desk by the gate staff of a Virgin flight which was departing to Heathrow, again the Delta staff told me it was Virgin's responsibility to rearrange my connection.  It was only when the Virgin gate supervisor informed them that I held a Delta through ticket that they started to look for a new flight to Manchester.  Although there were seats available on the Heathrow flight they would not book a shuttle to get me back to Manchester, neither could I take an Aer Lingus flight to Dublin with a connection to Manchester.  The only flight available to me was to go to JFK with Delta that evening (arriving 5am) and then to Manchester at 7.25 pm. I was assured that I would be allocated a hotel room for the 14 hour lay over. My flight to JFK was in comfort plus in the middle seat!! I boarded to find all the overhead lockers in that cabin full and had to fight my way further back on the plane to find space, I found out why they were full on getting off the flight as everybody seemed to have two bags stowed away). The guy in the aisle seat was clearly peeved that I was to sit in the middle seat.   What a rip off the comfort plus upgrade fee was, on a five hour flight there was no meal, all I got was a packet of crisps, a small bottle of wine and a crappy blanket! On arrival in JFK I approached the Delta helpdesk and was informed that I couldn't have a hotel room until 3pm, as I needed to be back to the airport for a flight at 7.25pm it was clearly impractical for me to check in.  I had no alternative but to wait in the airport for 14 hours, I could not even go to the Delta lounge to have a shower.  Fortunately my Virgin flight departed on time and the Premium Economy service was up to the usual excellent Virgin standard; on the 5 hour 50 minute flight we received a welcome drink, 2 small bottles of wine, a 3 course meal with tea or coffee, and a breakfast. Finally, on arrival at Manchester the Delta baggage tracker informed me my bag had been loaded onto a flight to Amsterdam! The customer service I received and the flight itself were both unacceptable and I wouldn't even rate Delta as a 1.",Negative

I was able to ask for blanket when a flight attendant walked by. He didn't acknowledge I needed assistance.  He said he didn't know but would check. He was gone and gone and gone. He finally came back and said he couldn't find one. Yet, when I walked to the back of the plane for a restroom people had blankets. I also noticed first class has blankets on the flight. This is unacceptable. I'm glad I didn't need a bag because I was getting sick like I did for the prior flight or it would have been an awful moment for me and everyone around me.",Negative

9757,Flew with Delta from Glasgow to NewYork last week. Despite asking to be sat together my husband and I were sat in middle seats in separate rows. We were both sat between people who were travelling on their own so I don’t see why we couldn’t sit together. On out return flight we tried online all week to book seats together but unless we paid a hefty supplement this wasn’t possible. At the airport we asked again and were told seats weren’t allocated yet but when we were boarding we would be allocated our seat and and would probably be sat together. On the contrary we weren’t even sitting in the same cabin. We talked to other people on the flight and it seems Delta does this all the time even splitting young kids from their parents. Also I was charged £45 for my case to go in the hold. Expecting this to be for both ways but on the return trip I was charged $56. When on the plane I went to put my hand luggage in the bin above my seat it was totally full of stuff belonging to the airline and when I asked where I was supposed to put my bag was told to put it in an overhead bin about 30 feet away.,Negative
9758,"They cancelled my reservation without even notifying me, then made me pay a fee to reinstate the ticket! Long story here, but I had booked a round trip weekend Delta flight through Priceline, but found out 3 hours before the outbound flight that I wouldn't be able to make it until the following day. Called Delta customer service and waited on hold for almost an hour only to have them tell me I had to talk to Priceline directly and that they had ""no control"" over my flights. Well Priceline always tell you to contact the airline directly so what a circle. After finally rebooking a later flight (and paying $300 extra), I didn't have time to call back Delta and tell them I couldn't make my outbound with all that was happening to make me miss my outbound. Fast forward to the night before my return flight and I never got a notification to check in for the flight, so when I searched my reservation, it said it wasn't valid. After contacting priceline they said that DELTA cancelled my return flight WITHOUT even notifying me! And that I had to talk to them if I wanted a new ticket but that I couldn't get a refund because delta was who did the canceling. After waiting to talk to delta customer service for almost ANOTHER hour, they still wanted to charge me $172 to rebook my return flight reservation that they had cancelled without even notifying me or asking or anything. Asked to speak to a manager and got the fee down to $50 but there is absolutely no reason I should have had to pay extra and go through all that hassle. Even if money was no object, there is no excuse for them not notifying me of the cancellation, and really no excuse for the cancellation in the first place. I am a loyal skymiles customer and fly delta frequently, I use the app and have notifications set up, and after this I frankly don't trust them with my business anymore. Extremely disappointed. Terrible business model to just cancel my reservation like that.",Postive

9761,"**EDIT- On looking through the reviews I notice that the majority of good reviews specify a European destination or departure point... meaning these flights are covered by  the EU Regulation 261/2004 (entitling late departures to compensation). Funny how Delta manage to get these flights away on time, when they are made accountable for them** Terrible experience. We were flying from Atlanta to Cancun. Everything was fine until we tried to take off. We were told there was a problem with the right engine, and maintenance would be looking at it while we waited on the plane. At this point, we were told we should be taking off in 30-60 mins time. An hour later, we were told it would be another hour. After another hour, we tried to take off again- no joy. Returned to the gate. We were still not allowed to disembark, and were told that the pilots were close to their daily limit of working hours- if we were to disembark and reboard, we may then end up waiting for new pilots. Frustrating, but fair enough. At this point we were given water and a tray of snacks was put in the walkway entrance for us to grab. These were the usual plane complimentary snacks (mini ritz/ mini cookies etc) and very quickly disappeared so many went without. I couldn’t eat anything offered due to gluten allergy. Another 2 hours later with next to no information, and the pilots had met their working hours deadline. We were told we could disembark. So that’s over 4 hours on a hot, stationary plane with just a small glass of water and no real food. We waited for a further 4 hours for the problem to be resolved whilst sitting at the gate. 2 hours into this wait we were given a bottle of water and snack packs were laid out in boxes for us to take, which I quickly realised I couldn’t eat due to my gluten allergy. We noticed customers walk over from other gates and even passers by taking the packs and they weren’t stopped- so there was a good number of people on our flight who didn’t get one. I asked the customer service rep on the gate if there was a GF option and was told I could ‘quickly run over to a restaurant’ to get food to bring back to the gate. I politely asked if there was anything else he could do to help as I had no cash with me to do this- my card had been lost on holiday in the US, and I had made what cash I had last up until this point. I had not expected to be buying food in the airport and literally had $3 on me (at this point I should have been in an all inclusive hotel). I added that I know the delay isn’t his fault, nor is it his fault I have an allergy, but just wondered if there’s any other option available. The ‘customer service’ agent was very rude- he looked me up and down and said in a very patronising tone, “honey I don’t have to give you food, or even water, but I did, what more do you want? Not my problem”. He then turned and walked away. I had been polite and respectful despite feeling very frustrated, so I didn’t expect to be spoken to like that. It felt as though I was being judged for being ‘fussy’ or ‘awkward’ when in actual fact I have a serious allergy. I also felt humiliated in front of all the other customers stood around the desk- I had spoken quietly to him and his response would have made other customers think I had been rude or demanding, when I hadn’t at all. I believe your staff should be educated on customers rights in such a lengthy delay- we were entitled to be provided food and most definitely water. At this point it was after 6.30pm and due to the delay and lack of GF options offered I had not eaten all day. My partner had had a small packet of cookies and a snack pack. We still had no idea how much longer we would wait. Any time anyone asked for an update throughout the entire delay period, we were told another hour. At this point, pretty much all of the passengers were exhausted, frustrated and becoming hopeless. Eventually we boarded around 8 hours late. A day or two later, we got an email giving us a $50 voucher to redeem against a delta flight. $50 between us both, as compensation for an 8 hour delay, and a pretty much full missed day of our all inclusive holiday. This would have been laughable if we could have even used it. If this was an EU flight, we would be entitled to cash compensation of €600 each. We live in England, and have no set plans for our next trip to the states (and we would be highly unlikely to book with Delta after this), so that was useless compensation to us. I sent a polite email thanking them for their offer, but explaining that we could not use the voucher, that we felt it was not comparable to the delay and resulting disruptions to our holiday, and asking if there was compensation that they could offer that would be more appropriate for our situation. I received a reply weeks later telling me they have ‘no obligation to compensate us at all’. That may be so, due to the lack of regulations such as the ones we have in the EU, but appropriate compensation and a gesture of goodwill would show a level of apology to us and would have potentially reinstated our faith in your company enough to book again in future. It also showed me where the ‘customer service’ rep at the gate got this attitude from. Disgusting customer service. When we do get to travel in the USA, we book numerous domestic flights and see as much as we can during our trip. These will most definitely not be made with Delta ever again after the experience we have had, and the lack of care in the customer service after it.

I had to see a dr. , had to have the visiting nurse come in and still receiving treatment from them and also seeing the dr. at the wound center, on top of having to take antibiotics. I had to have it debried twice which is very painful, and today  I was told that will always be a very sensitive spot. It took  me forever to reach someone at  Delta, when I did she put on my acct. a 300.00 credit but told me that it would be closed with her and she would have to transfer it to another dept.

The attendants were rude and totally uncaring.

But... they were able to send me a $7 check to replace the lock that was stolen when my bag was broken into.

All was fine until while I am getting on the plane I am told “your new seat is 7A.” When I asked if my husband’s seat was also changed I was told it was not. When I told them that was not acceptable (which I thought was obvious) they said we could sit together in 7A and 7B. The problem was they failed to tell that to the person in 7B who was already on the plane. After attempting to squeeze my 6’6” frame into the window seat I decided to sit in my original seat. At that point I was told I was in the wrong seat. When I explained the situation then and only then was I told that I was moved because they wanted to accommodate other people who wished to sit together. Not OK. I stayed in my seat.

9894,"So this morning I travelled to Sydney from Melbourne with family of 12 including 4 kids. As advertised each person allowed to carry 7 kg of luggage. However at the gates, a lazy, rude and unprofessional gate keeper randomly pick 3 of us and send us back to pay extra luggage. They have another guy at the back to process the payment of extra luggage. This guy just make random decision to charge 2 of us $195 for extra luggage fee. Each of us carry 12kg of luggage which we explain that it is our kids luggage as it is impossible to get the kids to carry even 5kg of item themselves. They don't bother to listen to us and force us to pay the fee saying that if we argue, they'll leave us and we won't able to fly. The guy blamed me for not processing the luggage as a group which is incorrect. He also said that he only work here and if other staff sent us back to him, his job is to charge us. I explained that we come in a group and the guy who sent us back processed us together. He told me to submit complaint to customer service (which I already suspect will only waste my time). We can confirm that all of us are not exceeding the baggage allowance and it even fall below it. For a record, we also come early before the gate even opened.  I tried to talk to the guy but he just play dumb and told us to go away. So I tried to complaint and explain to customer service online... And as expected, I chat with a human robot who only able to follow protocol which clearly designed to care, listen and treat customer fairly. Well... In the end of the day only monkey take peanuts and you get what you pay. However in this case the monkey is not only give you bad customer service but also rob you.

9895,f anyone airline could plumb greater depths it would have to surpass the low underhand way Jetstar drags money out of travellers. I had booked a low cost flight to Osaka but was informed of a covering list I was due to operate on during the booking. I immediately attempted to cancel the booking and was told I would not be able to rebook the flight. On pressing ok I was informed that the full sum of my booking would be forfeited. Now this was 2 hours after the booking was made. No amount of calling or using the useless electronic chat allowed me to engage a responsible manager. The minion protected their management and were only too glad to throw their rule book at me. This unconscionable behaviour by Jetstar riled me adequately to cancel 5000.00 dollars worth of Qantas flights. I suggest that anyone thinking of flying Jetstar not bother buying tickets with them and use a different airline. It is clear they rip off both customers and underpay staff. If this is their business model they should rightly close down and self off their miserable planes. Jetstar is low underhand behaviour everyday.,Negative
9896,"WORST AIRLINE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is my 2nd worst experience in 2 consecutive months. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Last month, November i was charge 45 dollars for 2Kg excess baggage from manila to Sg. The male staff was so rude and inconsiderate. You are the only airline weighing womens personal handbag and dont have a per Kg rate for excess. And after my bag was scanned for 2x i reached the boarding area there are Jetstar staffs asking the passengers to open up luggages, where on earth would you let your staffs comfortably open our bags after it has passed 2 scanner??!?Very disappointing!!!! Now again December, i booked my trip from Singapore to Hong Kong and you never failed to disappoint me! The flight time was 930am, the bus transfer picked all the passengers and let us wait for about 10mins inside the bus while the sun is high up. When we board the train, I used the toilet inside the plane and the smell of urine is very strong nobody cleaned it for our flight, its like the smell of a dirty public toilet. Very disgusting! When we board the plane at 935am theres an announcement the flight will be delayed. Delayed for 2 hours plus for technical problem. If you do your routine check you will find out from the start!!!! Your airline shouldnt have let us board yet. Its already almost lunch time and no offer of anything not even a free meal to compensate for such a delay! We are delayed 4 hours and 30mins! They keep giving us wrong departure time adding up to our frustrations! Our time was wasted, the entire day was gone. Very inconsiderate airline Jetstar is. I asked a male attendant why the plane is not leaving yet and again hes not even apologetic. You trained all your staff to be rude and greedy of money right?!?!?! When will i have a better experience with you??? Your planes are no longer new and dirty. Your staffs are rude. Seems like you dont value your customer anymore.

Instead of cancelling my plans and booking a hotel for 2 nights,  I was forced to pay another airline $400 to continue my trip.

Absolutely daylight robbery! The lady Hannah that we dealt with was not understanding and extremely rude rude to us (to the point I would say of being confrontational with us when it was not needed) when clearly we were not at fault and could have had an opportunity to add more to our cabin luggage. We also saw others being treated the same. It was one last day in NZ and it really left us with a bitter taste after such a lovely trip.

9934,"What an amazing guy! No exaggeration and my truthful and honest opinion- True to the core and an ""Outstanding"" professional!! The gem of a person who truly puts customer satisfaction and service as his #1 priority, no matter what it takes! Earlier this year in Feb 2016, we had requested a few travel quotes on Sulekha.com for my family who was planning to travel to India at the time. Abhijeet happened to be one of the travel agents who called us back, and we happened to connect since he offered us some great travel deals. And, mind you, the way he talks to you and convinces you, you would not put away the phone anyways, lol. But he was not a typical sales guy who would entice you into buying tickets even if you do not seem to be interested. He will do his best to make sure you feel comfortable about your needs, without being haunted by a pushy sales person. He is very understanding, and we have seen that he does his best to get you the best of deals available. In fact, despite our excellent business communication that became very friendly, we ended up having a misunderstanding about my family's return flight at the time. But, the moment he found out that I was not happy about what happened, this guy worked day and night to resolve it for us, and to make sure I regain my confidence in him, as well as have my piece of mind when my family travels. I was awed by his professionalism despite me being a bit upset about the whole situation at first. But what matter at the end of the day is the amount of efforts he had put in to make me a one ""happy"" client!! It is because of that awesome experience, we again approached Abhijeet earlier this month to book our fight to India. And, needless to say, he once again met our expectations at par. There was no other option for us. We had to come back to ""Journey Cook"", because that is one company I know that puts its customers first in the truest of terms. Abhijeet- You have impressed us beyond any words can express! Keep up the good work! And, as I always say- Honesty goes a long way, so stick to it!! There is a reason we came back to you guys the second time without you chasing us. We will recommend ""Journey Cook"" any day for your future travel needs, as long as they continue to conduct their business with the utmost sincerity and honesty the way they are doing right now. And, I am sure they will! :) P.S. I am not a person who would sit and devote time to write online reviews, but after experiencing such an exemplary service, I felt it would have been unfair if I couldn't take a few minutes of my time to appreciate someone who spent hours and hours to make our travel booking experiences such a pleasant one!!

9948,"This is an update to my previous 1-star review. After now having flown with them to Toronto (YYZ) and back from Stansted, both flights were in fact pretty good. I flew Premium, and the large seat, legroom, food and service were pretty well up with what you would expect from Premium Economy with BA etc. No in flight entertainment, though this does not bother me. The outbound flight left slightly early, and arrived at YYZ even earlier, to the point that we had to wait to be marshalled in. The A321neo was clean and in first class shape (same plane both ways). Cabin service was excellent and attentive. Return flight was delayed due to wrong food being placed on the aircraft, but this may have been a swissport fault (Primera's ground handling contractor at YYZ) rather than a Primera fault.I actually slept on the return flight, and for me sleeping on a plane is rare. A few loose ends here and there (e.g. no ground agent at YYZ baggage claim when one was PA'd for multiple times to sort out a baggage problem), but overall a very good experience, and I would fly with them again.",Postive

9951,"An absolutely terrible company - I vow to never use Primera Air again. For the past few months my partner and I have had nothing but trouble with this airline. They have poor communication to their staff, falsely advertise their service, always run delayed flights and cancel their flights last minute leaving poor customers stranded at airports in the early hours with no food or accommodation. My partner and I had 3 flights cancelled by them with 2 weeks notice - which was fair enough, I got my refund. HOWEVER, the problems began when my partner decided not to get a refund and instead opted for a Primera Air flight to another airport. When she arrived and got on the plane she was met with an old ""National Air"" flight that looked unsafe - It did not have any in-flight entertainment or headrests even though she PAID for this. The flight took off, circled the airport and then landed instantly as the plane was UNSAFE and had a technical error with the wing. The flight was then continually delayed by about 7 hours and then was suddenly cancelled around 2 in the morning. Poor passengers with families starved at the airport whilst promises of accommodation were being made by the company but were not delivered. There was no communication between Primera Air and Primera Air staff - as they had no clue what was going on and it seemed the passengers knew more than the staff! It was chaos and eventually my partner had to fork out thousands of pounds for another flight to London. It was absolutely disgraceful. Her next flight seemed like it would go better - wrong. This flight, again (from LONDON STANSTEAD TO NEWARK,NJ) was delayed by about 3 hours, and then another 4 at the airport. Again, she was put on the same shoddy ""National Air"" plane which did not seem fit for flight. Overall, we have regretted booking with Primera Air for the amount of stress it has caused us and I wouldn't wish that anybody has to go through the same. Take your money and spend it on a quality airline instead of one that leaves passengers stranded and cannot schedule a flight on time. Worst of all - If you are flying transatlantic BE PREPARED to not get what you paid for - be aware you might get dumped on some ramshackle 40 year old plane. Personally, I believe this company shouldn't be allowed to operate, the service is absolutely shocking. Don't expect a quick reply from them either - they take up to a month to respond to refund requests and their customer service wouldn't answer any of my tweets about their delays, despite them being online.

It was a sip in the bottom of the cup. WILL NEVER USE AGAIN",Negative
9956,"We had the most terrible start of our Holiday EVER!!! First you delay the fligt, later cancel it! With the best option for a week after! I can tell you for sure we and the rest of my Family, frinds and everybody I will talk to tell them this storry and WE WILL NEVER USE YOU AGAIN!!!! + 500 pepole has hear my storry, and I belive the other 150 pepole on the flight has done the same!!! Shame on you BAD and RUDE SERVICE. I RATHER PAY 10000 DKK EXTRA THAN THOUSING YOU COMPANY! All tours trips as bravoturs, if we see any sign of your Company, we´ll coose andtoer destanation / trip. Bravoturs is also an no go for us, nothing can make up for this, there service was as bad as yours! Thank you for making our Holiday LIKE Sxxx!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Negative
9957,"Same experience as some below. Was part of cancelled flight from Stansted to Newark. Only found out hours before the flight that it was cancelled and was given no resources to get home besides a suggestion to buy my own ticket and hope for reimbursement. The 1500 EUR that they say they'll pay for each ticket you buy on your own is nowhere near enough to get a ticket transatlantic on such short notice. Their customer service is terrible. Hours on hold, no email responses, etc. I will forever suggest people avoid this airline and will continue to hound them for my reimbursement.",Negative
9958,"This airline is AWFUL! Our flight to London was delayed 6 hours, only offered $10 airport voucher. When first purchasing our tickets we had paid extra to sit together (my husband, 2 year old daughter and myself) and they had us not sitting together when we got to the airport and told us we did not pay for that or our baggage. All lies, but they did switch our seats so we were together. We lost an entire day visiting with my husbands family in England. We then flew to Italy via easyJet. Our way home from Italy we had to return to London airport for a layover to get on our Primera flight back to Newark. We arrived in Stansted to find out our flight was completely CANCELED!! They sent out zero notifications to us (including the first delayed flight) gave us a piece of paper with numbers on to make a reimbursement claim, and told us WE HAD TO FIND OUR OWN FLIGHTS TO RETURN BACK HOME. We couldn’t find a flight till the next day which also was at a different airport an hour away. We then had to find a hotel to stay at for the night and get a taxi over to that hotel by the different airport. Our new flights alone were $5600, more than double then our original flights total and Primera did NOTHING to help us. Again, we were also traveling with our toddler. I wouldn’t recommend this airline to my worst enemy and from what I’ve read from other people, I wouldn’t be surprised if this company has some major lawsuits coming their way. They are stealing people’s money and have extremely poor customer service.",Negative
9959,"Booked Newark to London Stansted, the flight over was fine. On the way back they cancelled the flight on the day, just 6 hours before the flight time and they give you no help, no refund, they tell you to go buy a new one way ticket, which of course costs a fortune, and then you find out Primera Air take 4 to 5 months, or never to give any refunds and the 600 Euro they owe each passenger of a cancelled flight per EU law, apparently they almost never pay that either. I emailed them only to get an auto generated message saying you may or may not get a reply within 30 days !!! So this mob are total crooks, they leave you high and dry with no help, not even a hotel. if you didn't have the money to get home then your essentially left stranded and you have to find your own way home. Needless to say I will never fly with these evil crooks again More information: so having talked to some people here's what's going on - Primera has a tiny fleet and if a plane cannot run, under EU law they are required to provide hotels, food, expenses, they are required to provide a new flight home and 600 eur per passenger compensation, all of this is EU law and even on the Primera website they provide a link to the EU laws - the issue is they just don't follow them at all and they send you a text telling you to book a new flight and promise you up to 1500 euro per passenger, the problem is they drag out any payment for 5/6++ months, if they ever pay, and this is after many calls and emails and many hours of your time, and even then they try to offer you flight vouchers. They also just don't pay the 600 Euro compensation, nor do they ever give you hotel money etc. So here's how to deal with this crooked evil airline that leaves families stranded and are forced to pay huge last minute fares to get home: 1. call your credit card company and cancel the entire original charge an at least get your money back that way as Primera Air will do everything they can to delay or, or they just never reply to you 2. get onto one of the numerous companies that will fight to get your EU compensation money back you can find them on google, they will chase Primera and take a 30% fee for it, but its the only way you will ever get anything back 3. then once you have all your original fees back and you get your 400 euro back per person, then fight them for the balance - but at least you got most of your money back and it will hurt these evil crooks, take your money back and sic lawyers onto them and hopefully people will realize - do not chance your life and family on these evil crooks as they will leave you high and dry and they flout the law and think its funny",Negative

10085,"Having cancelled my return flight from Stavanger to Norway in March, Wizz Air failed to refund me for the flights. I contacted them via their complaints proforma online and was contacted very quickly by a member of their Customer Services team. Within a few days, I was told that the flights had been refunded. When I checked my balance was just showing the On-time Guarantee compensation, but no refund. When I enquired as to when I would receive the refund, I was told within 72 hours. This was over 3 weeks ago. I filled out a second complaint form and received no response. Today I have filled out a third one, however, I am really fed up with spending time and effort to recover the money owing to me. On top of all this, since Wizz Air started their route from Stavanger to London, Luton last September, they have continually cancelled and re-scheduled flights. Two friends had to completely cancel flights booked with them last year as the alternatives offered were so far off the original dates booked, they couldn't take the new ones. We had our Christmas outbound and inbound flights changed and I had go cancel and rebook my original March flights as when I attempted to accept the new return date offered, their system wouldn't allow me to do it. And to add insult to injury, Wizz Air have completely pulled the route from Stavanger to London as of the end of May, even though as of today, 3rd June, they are still advertising it! When you click on the link to book, there are no flights available. I also have over 200 Euros worth of credit for the on-time guarantee, which expire next week (3 month expiry) which due the current situation I am unable to use as the Norwegian borders remain closed and I would only book to go home to the UK anyway. All in all I am very dissatisfied with Wizz Air, which is a shame as I used to love to fly with them from Brno to London back in 2014/15.",Negative
10086,"I had to cancel a flight in February, way before the pandemic took hold as Wizzair rescheduled the flight. They allow an option of a full refund to your card in this case. This was after a very confusing online booking with flights disappearing, appearing fully booked, disappearing, reappearing half booked, etc. Fast forward to today, 2nd June and I've just rung them to find out where my refund is - ""we need your bank details as we cant refund to the credit card"". No mention of this anywhere or on any emails. Now its going to take up to 30 days to send the refund to my bank. I have flown with them before and in fairness, they were the same as any other budget airline. Just really poor customer service and they rely on being as uncontactable as possible.",Negative
10087,"Customer service has been OK. The reason for the negative review is how the company policy has damaged their customers. I was supposed to fly to Sofia, Bulgaria, with three friends in May for their 30th birthdays. I had booked the tickets for all four of us some time ago. Due to coronavirus, UK citizens have been barred from entering Bulgaria. However, Wizz Air have chosen to continue flying to Bulgaria to ""return people to their loved ones."" That's great, but I'm not Bulgarian and can't enter the country, so I'd obviously not go there or even be able to go there. Wizz Air judged our cancellation to be our choice - how, I don't know - because they're still flying. Therefore, on tickets amounting to £680, we received a total of £160 refund. I was able to get 50% of my ticket value back in Wizz Air credit because I have an illness that means I can't currently leave the country, but I have no idea why they think I'd ever willingly use their airline again. So, now myself and my friends are £130 out of pocket each. I was highly amused to read that Wizz Air expect to bounce back in one year, as opposed to other airlines who expect to get back to normal operation in more like two to three years...surprise! That's because they're greedily retaining the money of everyone who clearly can't fly. Avoid if you can.",Negative

I know my rights, and declining a refund when they cancelled my flight is ILLEGAL - they can offer me a voucher but it's up to me to accept it instead of a refund or not.

They keep saying only the finance department has the information but will never tell give you the contact details of the said finance department.

Then they cancel your flight. They tell you that you need to call a telephone number in order to change your booking. The number is not real. (I made twenty attempts to call. It did not even ring.) The only other way to book is via a travel agent. Travel agents have access to an electronic platform via which they can change a booking. When you do this, you find that Lufthansa's fake flights do not even appear on that system. Lufthansa are currently advertising a flight for EUR 80 on their website. The cheapest on the travel agents' system is for EUR 200. It is obvious from my experience that LH have no intention of honouring the EUR 80 ticket if you buy it.",Negative

All of this time Hannah, the Swiss Airline staff at Paris was rude, unpleasant and completely useless. She didn't know the number fo the company to call or what we could do to find the luggage.

10110,"HORRIBLE. Will never fly with Swiss again. I’ve traveled near and far and every other airline I’ve ever been on has had impeccable customer service in times of trouble. I flew from Amsterdam to Zurich today and my bag was lost somehow (even thought it was a direct flight only lasting an hour and my traveling companion’s bag was received immediately). When I first approached the customer service rep in Zurich airport baggage claim she was rude, unaccommodating and unapologetic. She offered no help in mending the situation. I am now in Switzerland with zero belongings, besides the books and charging cables which were in my carry on. After fussing with service reps I was told to file a report. Finally the bag was located STILL IN AMSTERDAM airport! The bag contained thousands of dollars of belonging and somehow SWISS is allowed to have a policy that only issues $100 of replacements to passengers flying in economy, BUT issues $300 to those in first class. ABSURD. I have been on and off the phone all day, completely ruined/wasted a day of my vacation, have been offered no reparations for the airlines mistake and here I am 12 hours later still waiting to find out when I will get my bag back and how. The worst experience I’ve ever had while traveling and I will not advise anyone to use Swiss air again. There are far better airlines that have higher focus on customer service and are more apologetic for their mistakes as well as try to help you in mending them. I am not angry that the bag was lost, as I understand this is a risk any traveler takes when checking a bag however I am irate in the way it was handled both in the airport and on the customer service phone lines throughout the day. Also a $100 stipend could buy me a new pair of sandals and a bra here in Switzerland, an outrageous offering from a multi billion dollar company that obviously cares little about customer comfort and satisfaction. Hopefully my bag turns up soon. Do not check bags with Swiss air unless you fully understand their ridiculous policy surrounding reparations for lost baggage. I wish I hadn’t",Negative

The rows were so close behind each other that it defies description. we´re seasoned travellers and know the days of comfort have long gone for economy travellers but this was horrific. truly awful. husband (a very calm, easy going guy) almost lost it in the window seat. i took window seat on return leg and found i was unable to get out of my seat (you cant raise armrest) with the row in front reclined. we had to wake them. poor crew did their best coping with the ultra narrow aisles....needless to say they didn´t often try bringing around water during the night. almost impossible to walk with waking passengers right and left of aisles. this is an experience i have no wish to repeat. steer clear everyone.",Negative

To be exact, I sat on the window seat, so I just assumed that she probably accidentally missed me out. Passenger that sat beside me notice that I didn't get my dinner, he called and inform the crew, and she gave me a weird stare when she passed me the dinner, it was uncomfortable and non-friendly. She didn't apologise for missing out me, and not even a single smile on her face, she was so cold, which makes me feel annoyed. During breakfast time, when she almost missed out to pass me my breakfast, the passenger that sat beside me informed and reminded her so that she wouldn't forgot me again, and gladly she didn't but I don't like her attitude. I'm not sure why this happened, I'm a Chinese, an Asian, not saying that she is racist, but she treated other caucasian passengers with so different attitude like laughing and talking to them, to be honest I don't think laughing loudly in front of your passengers consider as professional, this is such an unprofessional attitude. She is a flight attendant, she should be responsible on her job, and treat all her passengers equally with the same smile and same attitude no matter what are their race and ethnic.

Swiss - never again unless it's for a short trip! And by the way, the connecting flight to Berlkn was much more comfortable with a lot more space than the firdt one.

10121,"I flew from London to Geneva return with Swiss in December 2018. We had taken our ski equipment with us and it was in the hold, including my brand new £600 custom-fitted ski boots (in a boot bag, with my helmet and my moon boots). When we arrived at LHR my boot bag did not come out. We filled in the PIR and the next morning I was informed the bag would be returned that day. When it arrived the bag, my boots and my helmet were completely destroyed - it looked like they had gone through a threshing machine at Geneva (obviously why it didn't arrive). It was clear someone had been in the bag to see what had happened to my belongings as they were packed in a different order with the boots on top of the helmet when I received them back. I immediately wrote to Swiss using their online complaints form, including photos of all the damaged items. It took them over 6 weeks to respond (I also tried to contact them on Facebook and Twitter). Their response, when it came was that they basically did not care less as the PIR was for lost luggage (of course it was, it was lost at the point when I filled in the form). There would be no compensation as they expected me to manage for one day without the luggage (completely missing the point). When I filled out the customer complaint form it was for damaged luggage - which they ignored. I asked them to reconsider and again received a surly and discourteous response telling me they would not and that the matter was closed. They told me I would be contacted by K2 (their luggage repairer) however it has now been 3 weeks and nobody has. I've emailed them to ask why not, and again no response. Clearly my luggage is completely beyond repair - I have to spend £700 of my own money replacing all the items, including my ski boots - the toes and straps of which were completely sheared off. This is the worst airline experience I've ever had and I will never fly with or recommend Swiss to anyone. They did not even acknowledge the damage or apologise. Disgusting. I now realise that since they are in Switzerland there is basically no recourse to further complaints to any regulator so I guess buyer beware.

10137,"More important than the sale is the customer service. Before my purchase, Maliah called, emailed and texted daily, to ensure I was going to buy. After I purchased a vacation package for my son and his new brides honeymoon, I called, left message and emailed (several days ago) about airline seating upgrades (long flight) and have received no response. I spent upwards of $4000.00 and expected better. Package price is comparable to most travel agencies and I dont nickle and dime. What I look for is a good deal and service to match. This is clearly not Maliahs focus, not in my case anyway. My experience  is... If you're looking for good customer service before AND after the sale, perhaps this is not be the place for you or Maliah may not be the rep for you. If you've had luck here before, then good for you; otherwise, be honest, so others don't end up disappointed. Lesson learned",Postive

His service was excellent and he sets the standards to what customer service should be. From getting me quotes, to getting me my flight, to sending me a reminder, getting me on that jet, scheduling a pick up car upon arrival and also checking on me after i landed was honestly a customer service i never expected. He was very accomodating and patient and in so many words, very professional. An excellent experience and always available at any hours of the day or night.

When I accepted a job offer in a different state, Marisha immediately helped me find a flight that worked with my time schedule. From the time I accepted the job until I had to start was slightly over two weeks. Marisha was available seven days a week to help me get the flight booked.

She insisted my bag was too big and I showed her it wasn't by putting it in the shape with the required measures. Furthermore, she refused to give me her name by hidding her badge. Shame on you!

10210,"I was traveling with my family.  We checked-in at the Transavia counter at Schiphol airport en route to Tel Aviv.  The check-in lady put our 6 bags onto the conveyer belt and after sending them through she realized she still had one bar-coded tag in her hand.  She had omitted to tag 1 bag.  The untagged bag never arrived in Tel Aviv.  It was my mom's bag with everything she needed for 2 months abroad - she was devastated.  I spent every day of the two weeks I was with my parents speaking to Transavia.  They were courteous on the surface but in reality they were ruthless.  They sent me from one department to another and not person ever took an intelligent approach to try and assist finding the bag. I tried to establish the protocol of where an untagged bag on the Schiphol conveyer belt system goes, but nobody was really interested in helping.  They refused for me to speak to a manager and they blocked me every time i expected more than a one-line answer.  I was told not to call the call centre and not to use the customer service Whats App.  They only wanted me to send emails to one person and I had to wait days for an answer sometimes only to receive a meaningless so-called 'polite' answer.  The one person I was allowed to liase with went on holiday for a week during the process.  I also contacted Schiphol airport  - they too were polite in the introductory lines of their emails, but absolutely ruthless in their real approach - totally non-caring.  It was a very negligent error by Transavia's check-in lady and you would think they would make a concerted effort to make things right thereafter.  On the contrary, Transavia's customer service thereafter was absolutely cut-throat - they just wanted me to go away as if I was the problem.  It spoilt our holiday and the replacement cost of the bag plus all my mom's tops, dresses, shoes, toiletries, perfumes etc easily adds up to Euro 4,000 -Euro 5,000.  After what we've gone through due to Transavia's negligence do you know what they have offered us as compensation for the lost bag and all my mom's wardrobe and toiletries?  Euro 600.  That gives you an idea of the true culture of Transavia.",Negative
10211,"2 stars because we did get home (eventually). Poor customer service from the gate staff. If travelling (and I don't recommend) with Transavia make sure your hand luggage is no bigger than a hand bag or they will put it in the hold. Cabin crew again little or no customer service, no offer to help passengers fit luggage in overhead lockers, just stood and watched which only added to the delay. Ordered 2 x cokes, got 2 x white wines instead and when the male cabin crew asked his fellow female cabin crew what had happened she just mumbled, couldn't understand her Be prepared to be bused to the plane as their stands are not near the terminal. To summaries,  I would place them somewhere between Rhyno Air and Walking.",Negative
10212,"Excellent service. Great customer service, which can be contacted very easily on facebook and replies quickly. Great website, it looks good and it is very useable, something very rare with transporters' websites. Prices are cheap. Only downside: when you book a flight, it doesn't send you a confirmation of your reservation immediately. You have to wait a few hours to get it. This is very frustrating, as we don't know if we completed the reservation process correctly. Also, if you create an account after booking a flight, your flight doesn't get added to your account immediately. I had to enter the reservation number manually, even though I used the same email address for my account and for my ticket.",Postive

I have added the special assitance service online for my mom aged 67 years old, then confirmed it with customer support via phone. My mom ended up alone, abandoned at the hudge Orly airport with no assistance and caused me a lot of stress.

10215,"This is the worst airline I have ever encountered. After booking a flight with them almost a year in advance, they informed us a few months after, that the flight was cancelled and that they could re-book us with another flight, on a different date. We had to spend money on another hotel because of this, but had no choice, as other airline prices had gone up. Today, we received notification (with no reason what so ever!) that the new flight was also cancelled. This time, with no option to re-book. Well, there was, but to another destination. Useless, especially when it is on the inbound trip. Customer service did not really care, but we could get our money back. Wow, thanks. What a service. If you would like to fly at the price and date you agree with the Airline, then Transavia is not for you. If you prefer not knowing if you are actually going or not, and like to be forced to spend more money than necessary, then this is the airline for you. Good luck with that.",Negative
10216,"It is generally torture for persons above 185 cm to travel on economy tickets due to the restricted leg space. Sometimes it is possible to change seat - at a cost (which is discrimination of tall people!) but mostly it results in painful experiences, especially when the person in the seat in front of you insists on pushing his/her seat back, in spite of that that is physically impossible. TRANSAVIA is the company with least leg space I have experienced ever, and thus holds a leading position with regard to TORTURE and DISCRIMINATION of tall passengers. When available a fantastic leg space alternative at economy level is EMIRATES.",Negative

Without Williams help I would still be waiting for another person Justin at extension 259 to call me. I had sent  Many texts and phone calls trying to get him to call me back but Justin either was not available or forgot me or for whatever reason did not return my calls from the last 2 weeks! Justin started out helping me but as time passed so I must say did his interest in solving my problem.? William stepped in took charge and within 24 to 48 hours after we spoke for the last time within 24 hours I should say I had the money as a wire transfer in my bank account which was still owed to me from my refund. Yaaaaaa! I just want to say and thank him. Without Williams swift action I wouldn’t even consider rebooking with Travelopod now I might very well do so but it’s gonna take me some time because now I have to save up again because even though I got a refund that was still a considerable loss.

You get fairly frequent emails for great flight deals from the airport you choose when you first subscribe plus flight deals out of airports in surrounding cities. Obviously you can’t choose to which cities the flight deals will be, but if you have a date in mind to travel you will find a flight to an interesting place for your travel date. When you get the email you pretty much have to book within 24 hours (the sooner the better) but you can book the flight itself months in advance. I literally tell everyone I know about this service, I feel like I should be getting paid lol. If you like to travel and want to do it more often, Next Vacay makes it so much more affordable with this service.",Postive

Due to the current pandemic my travel plans have been cancelled. I have two upcoming holidays, and have booked various elements of both trips with a variety of companies, all of which I now have to communicate with. No other provider has been as quick and easy to deal with. They responded immediately on both occasions I contacted, they offered me the options to move forward, including a no-quibble refund. Despite the difficulty and the workload this company are facing, their customer service has been impeccable, and their reaction to this pandemic from a customer facing perspective has been head and shoulders above all other providers I have spoken to in recent weeks. I would certainly say you can book with confidence with My Transfers, and I certainly look forward to booking with them again - hopefully soon!

Customer service is rood and really unhelpfull for the clients.I order tickets before March,my tickets was canceled and I ask for refund in may but still no money or answer,they are saying that KLM has to confirm and complete the refund,but that is not true,because I actually spoke with KLM also!

Asked for a refund from Ryanair and they said they will reimburse the bank account that paid for the tickets (yes, you guessed it right, Bravofly paid for them with my money). They made up an email so they and only they can receive details about the flight including changes, cancellations, vouchers or refunds. They stopped sending me any information about the booking through their email address. Also, they said that I need to take care of bookings with the airlines, but I cannot log in to the Jet2 account because they have all the log in details. Moreover, when I tried inputting the booking ID on the Bravofly website to get to the customer service (ID that was sent by Bravofly to me) their response was that the booking ID is non existent. Truly awful company which I will definitely never use again.",Negative

I booked a flight via Bravofly but didnt receive any confirmation email. I contacted the customer service several times, no clear answer, just said that my booking is still processing and they will communicate with me in a few hours, I heard nothing. I did call them again and asked to cancel my booking then I can book another ticket through the airline but I was told that the money will not be refunded. After 5 days of waiting, they sent me a rejection email stating that they are not able to confirm my ticket!

Unable to contact them, my only recourse was to hit the Cancellation Icon on my ticket. Bravofly got back to me almost immediately, saying they were withholding 1/3 of my payment. When I contacted the actual airline, I was offered a travel voucher for the full amount, good for 24 months. Still not a word from Bravofly in the ensuing 18 days, even though the airline sent them an email notifying of this on 22 May.

I contacted the airline directly and was informed that no refund would be given due to the cancellations being caused by Argentina closing their borders. I then contacted bravofly and was told they could not give me any information regarding my refund nor could they confirm the total amount of the refund. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told no. I asked when I would know if there was a refund or a voucher and they said they could not tell me that. Worst customer experience. ever.,Negative

10610,Kiwi.com has sold me a ticket with self transfer in Kuala Lumpur while the airports regulations clearly states that passing through immigration or changing terminals is prohibited which would have resulted in me getting stuck in a single terminal with no means of flying home or finding accomodation. The flight was since cancelled and all the alternatives provided at a much higher price had exactly the same issue leaving the entire itinerary completely useless.

10614,Scam like business which does not allow you to amend your bookings with the carrier. Also I booked a flight + cabin bag for 66£ and after I claimed Wizz air credit got only 52.... somehow 14£ disappeared in between the nonsence way they set their bookings with carrier. AVOID !!,Negative
10615,"Company does not provide Airline Booking Reference! Airlines require your booking reference to do online check in.

It is therefore surprising that they treat the remaining business travelers like this.",Negative

This was not publicised by the UK Government, and Kiwi.com did not notify us of the changes when we booked our flights.  Because we did not have the QR code we were unable to fly out on the original flight.  We could not get hold of Kiwi.com.  Fortunately we were booked with British Airways and they were incredibly patient and helpful.  They rebooked us on a flight to Athens the next day at no extra charge.

Not only did we not get on the flights but the plane took off as did Kiwi with our money. We called Kiwi and reminded them that their pledge on their website states: ‘If we cancel your flight within 48 hours of departure you get to decide the refund’. This is a misleading lie. I have had numerous contacts with the company and continually get fobbed of. It’s obvious what’s happening here, the company are using their customer’s money to gain interest payments and then deduct a service fee. In my, and by the look of some of the comments on here, including a Facebook page named Kiwi the scam, a very untrustworthy company that needs investigating",Negative
10620,"Kiwi.com is extremely inflexible during Covid19, when it comes to granting cancellations due to changes in government travel guidelines. If your government's travel recommendations change advising you not to travel to certain countries, I think Kiwi.com should provide at least some cancellation options, which they did not - even though the actual Airline provided this. Furthermore, the call center person I spoke with was not very friendly, and I had to wait in line for 53 minutes, even though I kept getting updates ever 2 minutes that 'the average wait-time is 30 seconds'. It was just really tormenting.",Negative
10621,"Booked a flight to Morocco. Everything cancelled of course due to corona. Tried contacting Kiwi, but you're not allowed to call them until 3 days before your flight. Their phone line is a Indian call center. They offer three refund options which are all nonsense. According to European Commission, Kiwi needs to pay me back the full amount within 14 days. Kiwi rejects to do this and tells me that they are officially not a travel agency. Only option left for me to do is the European Small Claims procedure. Google 'European Small Claims Procedure' and just tell the court that they need to pay you back.",Negative
10622,"To begin with, I use this letter in which I emailed Kiwi.com. They refuse to give me full refund for services never rendered as they canceled mid flights indefinitely. There was no way I was sending my daughter in Israel to board a flight that was canceled mid way. I also canceled my reservation 1 week before departure as requested on website. I was told that they could give me a voucher but only $107 would be applied to rerouting plus a $250 fee would be attached to REROUTE.  They initially refused to give me a full refund only stating $107 was what I was entitled to with the carrier. The money was briefly refunded after I disputed with my bank, only to have a reversal deduction  from account 2 months later taking the $544 back out! The website and automated call center send you in circles with no help! To anyone considering using this travel site... I urge you DO NOT TRUST THEM!!!!! They are disgusting THIEVES and so after calling to fight the dispute AGAIN, I was told because I authorized the transaction. They said I would have to take it up with WIKI .  For STARTERS!!!!( EMAIL SENT)==== I have tried to contact your company several times and have been run around extensively and most thoroughly misled and cheated out of money with no services rendered and my daughter is stuck in a foreign country (Isreal) thanks to your GREED because your disgusting thieving company and airlines are taking advantage and misleading consumers when in all actuallity you are ripping them off!!!   2ndly maybe quit sending consumers in a run around with emails containing a link to a page that says it doesnt exist!!  3rdly give people MYSELF especially their FULL REFUND and quit scaming and cohersing with airlines to charge extra for rerouting and then not applying the $$ already paid then in which doubles the price of the ticket as a scheme to make more money for you  and your snake company while innocent people are taken advantage of and stranded!!! ! hope you can sleep at night with the fraudulant evil you are involved in!!!

Recently, I flew with Turkish second time and paid for a bassinet seat $300+ they even didn't provide us the required services and favored another woman who was Turkish. They told us that the seat assigned to my wife is ""out of service"" and moved my wife to sit with a male which we didn't accept and I sat there instead of my wife which sabotaged our whole travel. Later, they offered the same ""out of service"" seat to a Turkish woman and all the staff was giving her protocol looks like sure discrimination. On our second flight, they again forced my wife to sit with a male person for a bassinet seat (I assumed Turkish having majority Muslims at least should know the Muslim values) and we spoke to the staff but they were very unprofessional and rude and didn't entertain us. Finally, we didn't avail of the bassinet seat and exchange our seat with a kind person and sit together on a not-bassinet seat. We still have a return flight on January 4, 2020, let see how they treat us. To this point, I have decided to pay more but always fly with some good airlines (Emirate/Etihad/Qatar, etc.). I hope/pray this Airline will be out of business very soon, Insha Allah! I also see on feedback here they are saying that you have to file. Sure, I already filed a case which I know no one will read, here is the feedback number: 2942134. Oh just to mention, I have given feedback about their pathetic website a week ago and I never hear back from them. I will suggest staying away from this airline. And I don't want to mention their late flight which was 3 hours late.

Maybe they should seek to remove the individual who was going to charge me 420.00 for a refund I was entitled to receive.  The flight was cancelled by the airlines and it should have been a simple process according to the airlines and the manager over the individuals at my flight search, but it wasn't.  The only way I was able to get my refund was to dispute the charges with my cc company.  I should not have had to take that step if this company had just done the right thing.  I spent more than 10 hours on just one day trying to resolve this issue bit to no avail.  It is really ashame that people can't give honest reviews without the company wanting my review removed. I really doubt that I am the only one with a bad experience with this company according to other reviews I have read on the internet.  The people at this company and their manager turned their back on me.  They said it was illegal to charge for a refund but they still did not give me a refund.  I feel confident that I would never have received my money back of I had not taken the steps I took.  It should have only taken a few minutes not weeks and actually I waited over a month due to their request to wait until the week of my cancelled flight.  Maybe the company should work on improving their image, then maybe they would not have to worry so much about my review.",Negative

10716,"This is the worst travel company I have ever book with, during this horrible time with the COVID-19. They behave like they do not know what is going on in the world. They tried to take advantage of the Coronavirus crisis and charge additional fees for cancellations even the airlines' don't charge fees. After all struggles, they send me this email.""As per the conversation we are canceling your itinerary changes on your reservation with booking reference number"" I paid my ticket already and they are still talking about my reservation ticket. If I purchased my ticket already, what right they have to hold my ticket with themselves? At this point, I should be dealing directly with the airlines instead of travel agencies. Now I have to deal with them again to rebook my ticket. After that, I will never go back to this company for any other travels. Also, they said in their email, ""When you use the credit, there will be an airline penalty of 0.0 per person, plus any applicable fare difference. This credit is non-refundable and non-transferable, and may only be used by the person(s) named on the original ticket, regardless of the name on the credit card that purchased the tickets(s)."" I told them I will not pay any applicable fare difference also. Because the airline is saying on the airline's website that "" You will not be charged penalties or fare differences when you ticketing your open ticket, or when you benefit from Zero Change Fee, provided your new ticket is in the same cabin class."" It is clear to me that I won't be upgrading my ticket. So, this all tells me that the Exploretrip is just covering themselves and tried to get your money more in the future as taking advantage of the CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. Moreover, the person who on the phone with me and using a fake name behaved like checking with the airline the cancellations, etc. due to Coronavirus, coming back and every time changing the rule how they would cancel my ticket. Finally, they eliminated the fee they tried to steal from me at this crisis. Plus, every time they (I could hear people sound at the background) acted like I was not understanding their explanations and started to laugh at me. He has a thick accent and is impossible to understand, and impatient and display horrible customer service. They continue to laugh and continue speaking and I said ""I am your customer, you are rude"" and I hang up, I will also complain to BBB. This company is just trying to take advantage of Coronavirus Pandemic. They fun with their customers. I would not be surprised if they permanently go out of business during this horrible time of COVID-19 because they don't know how to treat their customers.

Explore Trip was happy to take my money months ago in December, 2019, before Coronavirus was even discovered, but unable to refund me anything. They tried to offer me then chance to reschedule my flight up to a year, but they couldn't even offer a flight that was anywhere near the price I paid originally so I was unable to reschedule to ANY flight (it had to be the exact same departure and destination). So, I told them to cancel my flights (departure and return) before I left on my trip on 3/19/20, and guess what, they couldn't even follow my instructions and do that. I called yesterday to confirm they had cancelled both my trips (and I gave them both PNR numbers: M38F4B, M32VER), and they hadn't cancelled either. As the situation with COVID-19 has been rapidly changing and restrictions increasing, I have called them over 6 times, and they were useless. They all have thick accents and are impossible to understand, and impatient and display horrible customer service. In fact, in 2 of those 6 times they HUNG UP ON ME for no reason.

After I connected to customer service,the guy on the phone did not give enough attention and care. Secondly, even my airplane company was giving free change because of corona virus, ExploreTrip rejected this and they said they can not change it. It was ridicules. Even they did not agree to change it with some fee. They were like in the mood of they do not care. Thirdly, after buying ticket, they blocked the amount of ticket cost on my credit card. But even I paid my ticket cost, I still had this blocked amount on my card almost one month after I bought ticket. Because they did not remove blocked amount quickly after payment. This is such a problem. So as a summary, I do not recommend ExploreTrip to buy ticket.",Negative

I abruptly found out when exploretrip has emailed me a week before my flight saying that no refunds will be made and that they apologize for it. I can understand if I canceled my own flight due to being afraid of the virus, but that was not the case at all, my flight was canceled on their behalf so shouldn't I get compensated back in full as I was telling the person I finally got ahold of on the phone (after 3 or 4 separate occasions). I lost out on $450 dollars and they said thats the best they can do due to circumstances, when told him someone else told me I can exchange my flight for a different one in the future, he said no that would make you spend even more money as well as this is the best that we can do, shall I proceed?

Instead of offering me a full refund, or a credit for the amount of my purchase, Explore Trip told me I could change my flight at no cost (if I know the new dates at the very moment I was speaking with the agent), or pay a supplier fee of $50 per passenger to receive the credit. I explained to the agent that the flights were booked for me and 3 of my friends, so I couldn't just pick a date without consulting with them first. The agent I spoke with told me I could consult with them and then call back. I didn't get around to calling back for around a week, and when I did, the agent told me the fee was now $75 per passenger. If I had booked through Porter directly, there would have been no additional fees. Considering what the airline companies are doing to compensate and accommodate travelers who were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, I think what Explore Trip has done is absolutely disgraceful. Not only was my trip cancelled, but I was forced to pay more money just so the money I already spent wasn't completely lost. Absolutely Ridiculous.

She would not send us our trip information, had much of the information wrong resulting in incorrect booking of rooms and costs us much more than originally quoted ( forgot to put our children on the trip itinerary, had us in two rooms when we only needed one, had no idea what time we were flying out, etc).When we called to ask questions about a variety parts of the vacation, we could not get a phone call back, had to call vacation express and received little to no information because we ""booked with an agent"". Throughout the entire process we found out more information by researching (picking seats on plane, info needed for customs) and once we arrived at our destination, none of our rooms were together. I would think if you go through a travel agent, you are paying for all of the little odds and ends of the vacation to be taken care of...this clearly did not happen. VE did very little help, with the exception of Karen Tyler, who was able to get me what I needed the same day when requested. After all of my research I learned Sun Wing owns everything involved in the vacations offered- Vacation Express, Miami Air, the resorts etc. They seemed to have cut corners to save money.

On the 3rd call was advised again of 23kg so decided to stick with that so called again and booked excess baggage last Friday 14th (flying Tues 18th am - tomorrow) and paid on the phone with my card £139, the lady said she would send an email confirming this. By the Monday no email had been received so I called again, and was quoted a higher price £142 and told that the lady who made the initial booking wasn't authorized to quote me a lower figure, I asked him to go back and listen the recording, which he claimed to have done but refused to proceed with the luggage increase unless I paid the increased cost, then he hang up on me after pretending he couldn't hear me. I called again and asked to speak with a Manager, the man who I dealt with seemed to struggle to understand basic English but reconfirmed that the luggage had not been booked - presumably this is a ploy so we are forced to pay the vastly inflated sums at the airport? He put me back through to the original lady who told me that it had been confirmed and she put me back through to Manager who promised that a confirmation email would be sent through within 10 mins. An email was received, however the price had increased again (without my agreement), and the 2 receipts attached to the email did not actually state what the excess values of the baggage was - thus rendering the receipt pointless. Given the fact that staff told me a different story each time I called, I obviously could not trust a thing they say. I called back again and spoke again to the original lady and told her the receipt is pointless as it doesn't state that I have paid to increase the luggage from 23kg to 32kg and an extra bag at 23kg - she proceeded to tell me I then had to email customer services - something she said she was unable to do herself.  Of course the email bounced back. Even before the flight was boarded there was a lack of consistency, increasing the price and taking a value from my card that was not quoted, nor agreed by myself (which I would actually classify as theft), their inability to understand plain English, their lack of assistance and ability to provide an even half decent level of service. I spent in excess of 3hrs on the phone to them without achieving anything. Was hung up on and lied to - not to mention the considerable stress levels this has created. God knows what the actual flight will be like if they cant even get this right..",Negative
10776,"I decided to write something as I was scared before my first flight reading opinions here. I was flying several days ago from Berlin to Istanbul and everything was fine. There was a slight delay of first flight but we were in Istanbul on time. For the second flight the boarding started very late and we had to go to another gate however apart from this everything was ok, the staff was nice and it was a pleasant jurney.",Postive
10777,"One is too many stars. In all fairness, I used them 3 times before with no problems, but when the problems came they were huge! Like others I booked a trip last Nov for a week in Cancun supposed to be this month, my adult son and his girlfriend did too. Like everyone else, we got an email in March saying basically sorry, we didnt pay your resort, you have no reservations and we aren't giving refunds, call your bank and eff off. If they are in business again run...run fast and far no matter how good the deal sounds.",Negative
10778,"Thieves!  One star is one too many. Do not use bookit for your trip. They have lied over and over again telling our banks/credit card companies that they have refunded our money after cancelling all trips due to COVID-19 which is not true. We have gone through so much to get a refund and many are still waiting, including us. Check out the Facebook page, Scammed By Book It.",Negative

10781,"I was supposed to Jamaica April 2020. Due to the virus, my trip was canceled. On March 18, I canceled my trip and Bookit sent me emails stating the amount I would be refunded. I waited 10 business days and there was still no refund. I attempted to go online and contact customer service, but I found out Bookit was down! All the phones were off!! On the website, it advised me to go to my credit card company to get a refund since they would not be doing it. After 2 months of fighting my credit card company I finally got a refund. I will never use Bookit ever. HOW HEARTLESS CAN A COMPANY BE TO STEAL MONEY FROM A PERSON ESPECIALLY DURING THE PANDEMIC!!!",Negative

At the first sign of struggle through COVID, they closed their doors, cancelled our trip, and did not offer us a refund. 2 months later, still trying to get refunded through Consumer Protection with my bank. We no longer have a honeymoon, as we don’t have the money to pay for one right now. Stay away from Bookit. I hope the owners fail to sleep at night.",Negative
10784,"They Shut down their business and took our money.We booked a trip and they cancelled it, we received no credit no refund and they have the nerve to not answer the phones. They claim it’s Covid-19, but back open and taking reservations for future trips. No return calls, customer service workers are limited and they computers have no information on helping us with our booking. They ruin a family vacation and caused more pain to my family than Covid-19 did.",Negative
